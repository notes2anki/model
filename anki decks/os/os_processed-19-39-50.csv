"Chapter 6: Process Scheduling Strategies

6.1 Introduction
In operating systems, process scheduling plays a crucial role in efficiently managing and coordinating processes. It involves determining the order in which processes are executed by the CPU. Various scheduling strategies exist, each with its own advantages and considerations. In this chapter, we will explore different scheduling strategies and their applications.

6.2 The Queue of Processes Waiting on a Lock
When dealing with lock-based synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes or semaphores, processes often need to wait for a lock to be released before they can proceed. A queue is maintained to keep track of these waiting processes. This queue, specifically referred to as the entry set of a lock, stores the processes in the order they arrived, maintaining fairness and ensuring that all processes eventually get access to the lock. This concept of a queue helps in effectively managing the synchronization among processes.

6.3 Priority Scheduling Strategy
Priority scheduling is a commonly used strategy in process management. It assigns priorities to processes based on certain criteria, such as the length of their execution time, their importance, or their resource requirements. Under the priority scheduling strategy, the process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. In case of ties, additional criteria, like arrival time or process ID, may be used to break the tie.

One specific example of the priority scheduling strategy is the shortest-job-first strategy - a variation of priority scheduling where the process with the shortest burst time is given the highest priority. This approach ensures that the CPU is utilized efficiently by minimizing the waiting time for short jobs, resulting in improved system throughput.

6.4 Conclusion
Process scheduling is a vital aspect of operating system design. Various scheduling strategies help in efficiently managing processes and ensuring fair and optimal resource allocation. The entry set of a lock provides a queue-like structure to handle processes waiting for access to a lock. Additionally, priority scheduling, and its variation shortest-job-first, prioritize processes based on predefined criteria, resulting in effective utilization of system resources. In the next chapter, we will dive deeper into other scheduling algorithms and their characteristics.","[Front: The queue of processes waiting on a lock is sometimes called a ________.
