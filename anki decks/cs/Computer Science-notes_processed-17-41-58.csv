Title: Introduction to Computer Programs and Algorithms

Chapter 1: What is a Computer Program?
A computer program is a set of instructions that we want a computer to perform. It is a collection of commands that tells the computer how to solve a specific problem or complete a desired task.

Chapter 2: Understanding Algorithms
An algorithm is a step-by-step process that we want a program to accomplish. It provides a clear and structured approach to solving a problem. For example, if we want to write a computer program to toast a piece of bread, we would first define an algorithm that outlines the necessary steps. However, it's important to note that algorithms may need to consider various details and assumptions, such as user preferences, cultural differences, and potential alternatives.

Chapter 3: Designing Effective Requirements
Design requirements are essential in developing successful applications. They help developers identify what the application should and should not do when it is complete. Design requirements involve collaboration between developers, users, and customers. This stage typically starts by gathering input from clients, customers, and stakeholders about the desired functionality and problem-solving objectives of the application.

-------------------","[Front: What is a Computer Program? Back: A computer program is a set of instructions that we want a computer to perform.],
[Front: What is an Algorithm? Back: The step by step process that we want a program to accomplish. i.e. If we want to write a computer program to toast a piece of bread, we would first write an algorithm. This algorithm might look something like this: 1. Take the bread out of the bag. 2. Place the bread in the toaster. 3. Press the toast button. 4. Wait for the toast to pop up. 5. Remove the toast from the toaster. At first glance, this algorithm seems to solve our problem. However, our algorithm leaves out many details and makes many assumptions, for example: 1. What kind of toast does our user want? Does the user want white bread, wheat, or some other kind of bread? 2. How does the user want the bread toasted, light or dark? 3. What does the user want on the bread after it is toasted: butter, margarine, honey, or strawberry jam? 4. Maybe the user wanted another kind of toast, like French toast or garlic toast, which is prepared by means other than a toaster. 5. Does this algorithm work for all your users in their cultures and languages? Now, you might be thinking we are getting too detailed for just doing a simple toast program. Over the years, software development has the reputation of taking too long, costing too much, and not being what the user wants. This reputation came to be because computer programmers often start writing their programs before they have really thought through their algorithms.],
[Front: What is Design Requirements? Back: The key ingredients to making successful applications starts with design requirements. Design requirements can be very formal and detailed or a simple list on a piece of paper. The importance of design requirements is they help the developer flesh out what the application should do and not do when complete. Design requirements should not be completed in a programmer’s vacuum but should be a collaboration between developers, users, and customers. Design requirements usually begin by asking clients, customers, and or stakeholders how the application should work, what problems it should solve, and how the app should solve the problem. Requirements can include long or short narrative descriptions of the app, screen mockups, and formulas.]"
"-------------------
Title: User Interface Design and Debugging

Chapter 1: The Importance of User Interface (UI) Design
The user interface (UI) design is a key ingredient in an effective application. It involves designing the layout and visual elements that users interact with. Many software developers begin with UI design and then derive design requirements from their screen layouts. Feedback from clients and potential users is crucial during this stage, helping refine the design before programming begins.

Chapter 2: Identifying Bugs and Error-Free Programming
After programming, it is important to ensure that the program aligns with the design requirements and user interface design. Errors in programming are commonly referred to as bugs. Detecting and fixing bugs is essential to deliver a reliable and functional application.

-------------------","[Front: User Interface? Back: key ingredient to your successful app is the user interface (UI) design. Many software developers start with the UI design, and after laying out all the screen elements and having many users look at paper mock-ups, they then write out the design requirements from their screen layouts. Once you have done your best to flesh out all the design requirements, laid out all the user interface screens, and had the client(s) or potential customers look at your design and give you feedback, coding can begin. Once coding begins, design requirements and user interface screens can change, but the changes are typically minor and easily accommodated by the development process.],
[Front: What is a Bug? Back: After programming, we need to make sure our program 1) matches the design requirements 2) user interface design 3) there are no errors. In programming vernacular, errors are called bugs.]"
"-------------------
Title: Quality Assurance and Debugging in Software Development

Chapter 1: Importance of Quality Assurance (QA)
Quality Assurance (QA) is a vital component of software testing methodology. It involves thorough testing performed by experienced individuals who didn't write the application. QA ensures that the software meets the defined requirements and functions as intended.

Chapter 2: Debugging and Iterative Development
During the testing phase, developers collaborate with QA staff to identify and resolve issues in the application. This process is known as debugging. It often leads to changes in design requirements and user interface elements to enhance the application's usability. Iterative development, involving repeated cycles of testing and refinement, is common in this phase.

-------------------","[Front: What is Quality Assurance (QA)? Back: Someone who is experienced in software testing methodology and who didn’t write the app performs this testing. Software testing is commonly referred to as Quality Assurance (QA).],
[Front: Debugging? Back: During the testing phase, the developer will need to work with QA staff to determine why the application is not working as designed. The process is called debugging. Frequently during testing and debugging, changes to the requirements (design) need to occur to make the application more usable for the customer. Once the design requirements and user interface changes are made, the process begins over again.]"

Title: Fundamentals of Computer Science

Chapter 1: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that utilizes objects, which are instances of classes, to design applications and computer programs. It represents concepts as objects that have associated data fields (attributes) and procedures (methods).

Chapter 2: Understanding Objects, Properties, and Methods
In OOP, an object can be visualized as a collection of nouns and verbs. Properties are the nouns, representing attributes or characteristics of the object. On the other hand, methods are the verbs, defining the actions or behaviors that an object can perform.

Chapter 3: Overview of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a tool used by computer programmers to write, test, and debug programs. It provides features like code editing, debugging, and project management, simplifying the development process and increasing productivity.

Chapter 4: Bits, Bytes, and Moore's Law
Bits are the basic units of information used by computers, having a value of either 0 or 1. A byte, composed of 8 bits, can represent up to 256 different values. Moore's Law, formulated by Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore, states that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years, leading to significant advancements in computational power.

Chapter: Fundamentals of Computer Science

Section 1: Binding
Binding refers to the process of specifying a mapping from a name to a particular object or resource. In computer science, binding is commonly used in various contexts, such as variable binding in programming languages or name resolution in networking. By assigning a name to an object, binding allows for easy referencing and access to the associated resource or functionality.

Section 2: Bits
Bits, short for binary digits, are the basic units of information in digital systems. Bits can take on two possible values: 0 or 1, representing the absence or presence of an electrical charge, respectively. They form the building blocks for representing and manipulating data in computers, where complex information is stored and processed as sequences of 0s and 1s.

Section 3: Blocking
Blocking refers to a situation in which the sending process is blocked or halted until the corresponding receive operation is issued. In communication systems, blocking can occur when a process is required to wait for a response or acknowledgement before proceeding further. During the blocking period, the process remains unresponsive until the necessary conditions or events are fulfilled, allowing the communication to proceed.

Section 4: Boolean
Boolean refers to a variable or expression whose value can be either true or false. It represents a binary logic state, inspired by the mathematics of Boolean algebra. Boolean values are essential in programming, as they form the basis for decision-making, conditional branching, and logical operations. Boolean variables are typically used to control program flow and store the outcome of logical comparisons or conditions.

Section 5: Broadcast Communication
Broadcast communication is a form of communication in which each packet or message is transmitted to all computers or devices in a network. Unlike unicast or multicast communication, where packets are targeted to specific recipients, broadcast communication ensures that every connected computer receives a copy of the transmitted information. Each device or computer then identifies and processes the packets addressed to it, allowing for widespread information dissemination.

Section 6: Buffer Gate
A buffer gate is a logical gate that does not change the logic level of the input but isolates or amplifies the incoming signal. It acts as a buffer or intermediate stage in a digital circuit, preventing the signal's degradation or interference while maintaining its integrity. Buffer gates are commonly used to drive multiple loads or inputs without impacting the quality or voltage levels of the original signal.

Section 7: Bug
A bug refers to a logical error or flaw in the execution of software. Bugs can cause unexpected behavior, crashes, or incorrect results, and they can be challenging to identify and fix. Debugging is the process of locating and resolving bugs. It involves analyzing the program's behavior, examining code, and applying various debugging techniques to eliminate the errors and restore the software's intended functionality.

Section 8: Byte
A byte is a unit of digital information or data consisting of 8 bits. It represents a basic addressable unit of memory storage in most computer architectures and is used to store and process a wide range of data types, including characters, integers, and images. In Java, a byte is also a data type used to represent an 8-bit signed integer value, ranging from -128 to 127.

Section 9: Bytecode
Bytecode refers to platform-independent instructions created by the Java compiler for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It serves as an intermediate representation of Java programs, allowing them to be executed on any system that has a JVM implementation. Bytecode combines the benefits of being human-readable (compared to machine code) and portable, enabling cross-platform compatibility and efficient execution of Java applications.

Section 10: Call Stream
A call stream is a communication facility that combines synchronous and asynchronous Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), making the different forms of communication invisible to servers.

"Generalization is a relationship between a class and one or more refined or specialized versions of it. In object-oriented programming, generalization is based on the concept of inheritance, where a class can serve as a base or parent for other classes. The specialized classes, known as subclasses or derived classes, inherit properties and behaviors from the general class, known as the superclass. Generalization enables code reusability, as common characteristics can be defined in the superclass while specialized features can be added in the subclasses.

A gigabyte (gig) is a unit of digital information storage that represents a little over 1 billion bytes (2^30 bytes). It is commonly used to quantify the capacity of computer storage devices such as hard drives and memory modules. With increasing data demands, gigabytes have become a standard unit for measuring and comparing storage capacity. The prefix ""giga"" denotes a factor of 1 billion.

Gossip architecture refers to a replication architecture in which replica managers periodically exchange messages to notify each other of updates. Replica managers are responsible for maintaining consistent copies of data across multiple nodes in a distributed system. In a gossip architecture, each replica manager spreads information about updates to other replica managers in an epidemic-like manner. This approach ensures that updates propagate efficiently throughout the system, allowing all replica managers to eventually converge to a consistent state.

Group multicasting is a communication model for communication between groups of cooperating processes. In group multicasting, a sender process transmits a message to a group of receiving processes simultaneously. The sender process sends a single copy of the message, and the underlying network infrastructure ensures that the message reaches all intended recipients efficiently. Group multicasting is particularly useful in distributed systems where multiple processes need to receive the same information simultaneously.

A guard condition is a Boolean expression that must be true in order for a transition to occur. In the context of state machines or process modeling, a guard condition determines whether a transition from one state to another can take place. If the guard condition evaluates to true, the transition fires, and the system moves to the specified state. If the guard condition evaluates to false, the transition does not occur, and the system remains in the current state. Guard conditions help in defining the conditions under which transitions can or cannot take place.

A guarded transition is a type of transition that fires only if a guard condition associated with it is true. In state machines or process modeling, transitions depict changes in the state of a system. A guarded transition provides additional flexibility by defining conditions that must be met for the transition to occur. If the guard condition is false, the transition remains inactive, and the system remains in the current state. Guarded transitions allow for more complex behavior and decision-making within a system's state model.

Half-duplex is a term applied to data transmission in which data can only be sent or received in one direction at a time. Unlike full-duplex communication, in half-duplex, only one channel is available for data transmission at a given time. This means that devices can either send data or receive data at any given moment, but not both simultaneously. Half-duplex communication is commonly seen in technologies like walkie-talkies or in certain network configurations where bidirectional communication is not required simultaneously","[Front: generalization Back: the relationship between a class and one or more refined or specialized versions of it],

PSE, which stands for Packet Switching Exchange, is an integral component of the packet-switching network technology. It refers to a packet switch that operates within a network. Packet switching exchanges allow for the efficient transfer of data by breaking it into smaller packets, which can be routed independently through the network.

In object-oriented programming, a public member refers to a variable or function that can be accessed by all objects. This means that the member is not restricted to specific classes or their subclasses, allowing any object to access and use it. Public members provide a way to expose certain properties or functionalities of an object to the wider program.

Quadratic efficiency is a measure of algorithm efficiency that determines the run time proportionate to the square of the number of elements being processed. Algorithms with quadratic efficiency have a time complexity denoted as O(n^2), where n represents the number of elements. The performance of such algorithms typically decreases rapidly with an increase in the input size.

In object-oriented programming, a qualifier refers to an attribute of an object that helps distinguish among the set of objects at the ""many"" end of an association. Qualifiers provide additional information or characteristics that aid in identifying specific instances of a class or object. They allow for more precise or customized handling of objects within a collection or group.

A query operation is a specific type of operation in programming that returns or computes a value without modifying any objects. It is used to retrieve information or perform calculations based on existing data.

Remote Procedure Calling (RPC): Remote Procedure Calling is a communication construct that conceals operations behind a procedure-calling abstraction and is implemented in terms of a request-reply protocol. It enables a program to invoke a procedure or method on a remote system as if it were executing locally. The underlying communication protocol handles the exchange of messages between the client and server, allowing for transparent remote execution.

Replica Manager: A replica manager is a process that holds replicas of data items and performs operations on them directly. It is responsible for maintaining the consistency and availability of replicated data in a distributed system. Replica managers coordinate with each other to ensure that updates are propagated correctly and that all replicas stay synchronized.

Replication Transparency: Replication transparency is a type of transparency that enables multiple instances of information objects to be used to increase reliability and performance without knowledge of the replicas by users or programs. It ensures that clients accessing replicated data are unaware of its replication status and can continue to interact with the system regardless of the number or location of replicas.

Request Protocol: The request protocol is an RPC exchange protocol used when no confirmation or value is required from the executed procedure. In this protocol, the client sends a request message to the server, which executes the procedure and does not provide a reply message back to the client. This protocol is suitable for situations where the result of the procedure is not needed or can be obtained independently.","[Front: rational number Back: a number that can be written as an integer divided by a non-zero integer],

"Request-Reply-Acknowledge Protocol: The request-reply-acknowledge protocol is an RPC exchange protocol that uses a separate acknowledgement message in addition to the request and reply messages. This protocol ensures that the client receives explicit confirmation that its request was received and processed by the server. The acknowledgement message adds an extra layer of reliability to the communication between client and server.

Resource Manager: A resource manager is a software module that manages a set of resources of a particular type. It controls the allocation, deallocation, and utilization of resources, ensuring that they are used efficiently and in accordance with predefined policies. Resource managers can oversee various types of resources, such as memory, files, database connections, or network sockets.

Resource Sharing: Resource sharing refers to a situation in which multiple entities within a distributed system use the same set of hardware, software, and/or data. It allows multiple processes or users to access and utilize resources simultaneously, leading to efficient resource utilization and better system scalability. Resource sharing mechanisms ensure fair access and prevent conflicts between entities competing for the same resources.

RMI (Remote Method Invocation): RMI, or Remote Method Invocation, is the technology that enables a program to execute a method of an object on a different system. It facilitates communication and interaction between distributed objects, allowing method invocations to be performed remotely as if they were executed locally. RMI provides a seamless way to build distributed applications by abstracting the complexities of network communication and object serialization.

Role: In the context of associations, a role represents one end of the association between two objects. It defines the participation and behavior of an object within the association, specifying the responsibilities and attributes associated with that object. Roles help establish the relationship between objects and allow for effective modeling of object-oriented systems.

RPC (Remote Procedure Calling): RPC, or Remote Procedure Calling, is a communication mechanism that allows a program to call a procedure or method on a remote system. It provides an abstraction that allows the client to invoke operations on the server as if they were local function calls. RPC handles the complexities of network communication, data serialization, and remote execution, making distributed programming easier and more transparent.

Russell's Paradox: Russell's Paradox is a logical contradiction in set theory discovered by the British mathematician Bertrand Russell. It arises when considering the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The paradox questions whether this set contains itself or not, leading to a contradictory situation. It highlights the fundamental limitations and challenges in formalizing set theory and has significant implications for the foundations of mathematics.

"- Monkey Patch: This term refers to the practice of extending or modifying the run-time code of dynamic languages without altering the original source code. It is also known as duck punching or shaking the bag. Monkey patching allows developers to add or modify functionalities of existing objects or classes at runtime. This technique can be quite powerful but should be used with caution to avoid unexpected behavior.

- Polymorphism: In the context of programming, polymorphism means that the meaning of an operation depends on the objects being operated upon. It allows different objects to be treated as instances of a common type, enabling them to be used interchangeably through a shared interface. Polymorphism promotes code reuse and flexibility by allowing the same code to work with different types of objects, eliminating the need for duplicating code for each specific type.","[Front: monkey patch Back: extend or modify the run-time code of dynamic languages without altering the original source code aka duck punching and shaking the bag],

They are commonly employed in various fields, including computer science, linguistics, and project management.

- Kernel: The term kernel typically refers to a computer program that sits at the core of an operating system. Its main function is to manage input/output requests from software and translate them into data processing instructions for the central processing unit (CPU). The kernel plays a crucial role in providing essential services such as memory management, process scheduling, and device control.

- Data Sizes: In computing, data sizes are typically measured in various units depending on their magnitude. The most common units include bit, byte, kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte, exabyte, zettabyte, and yottabyte. A bit represents the smallest unit of data, while a byte consists of 8 bits. The sizes increase exponentially, with each subsequent unit representing a greater quantity of data. For example, an exabyte is bigger than a petabyte, and a terabyte is smaller than a petabyte.

- Linked List: A linked list is a data structure that creates a chain of data, where each item, known as a node, points to the next node in the sequence. This dynamic structure allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements at any position within the list. Linked lists are commonly used when the size of the data is not known in advance or when frequent modifications are expected. However, accessing arbitrary elements in a linked list is less efficient compared to arrays.

- Recursion: Recursion is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller sub-problems that can be solved independently. The solution to the original problem can then be obtained by combining the solutions of the sub-problems. In programming, recursion often involves calling a function within itself, allowing the function to repeatedly solve smaller instances of the problem until a base case is reached. Recursion provides an elegant way to solve certain types of problems, such as traversing hierarchical data structures or implementing mathematical algorithms.","[Front: DAG Back: Directed Acyclic Graph May also be used to model processes in which information flows in a consistent direction through a network of processors],

"- SUT: SUT stands for System Under Test. It refers to the specific system or software component that is being tested or evaluated. When conducting software testing, the SUT represents the target of the test, and various test cases are executed to verify its functionality, performance, or other desired qualities.

- Red-Green-Refactor: Red-Green-Refactor is a workflow often used in test-driven development (TDD). The process involves three main steps: red, green, and refactor. In the ""red"" phase, developers write a test that should initially fail, indicating that the desired functionality is not yet implemented. In the subsequent ""green"" phase, the developers write the minimum amount of code that passes the test, ensuring that the functionality is correctly implemented. Finally, in the ""refactor"" phase, the code is reviewed, improved, and optimized while maintaining the passing tests. This iterative process helps ensure the quality and correctness of the codebase.

- Snake Case: Snake case is a naming convention for writing compound words or phrases in which the elements are separated with underscores (_). It is commonly used in programming languages, file naming, and web development. For example, ""my_variable_name"" is written in snake case. Snake case improves readability by providing visual separation between words and is often preferred over other naming styles, such as camel case or kebab case, in certain contexts.","[Front: SUT Back: System Under Test],

"- LIFO Stack Structure: LIFO stands for Last In, First Out, and it refers to the behavior of a stack data structure. In a LIFO stack, the last element inserted is the first to be removed. Elements are added and removed from only one end of the stack, known as the top. The LIFO property enables efficient insertion and removal operations. To add an element, it is pushed onto the top of the stack, and to remove an element, it is popped from the top.

- REST API: REST API, short for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a widely used architectural style for designing web services. REST APIs employ the use of the four HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to execute operations and exchange data over the internet. They rely on a stateless client-server communication model and emphasize the use of unique resource (URL) identifiers and standard HTTP protocols. REST APIs are highly scalable, flexible, and interoperable, making them suitable for modern distributed systems.

- This means that you can only perform operations that are valid for its type.
- Strong typing helps catch errors at compile-time and improves code reliability.

3. Merge Sort
- Merge sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that operates on arrays.
- It divides the unsorted list into smaller sublists until each sublist contains only one element.
- It then repeatedly merges the sublists to produce new, sorted sublists, until there is only one sorted list remaining.
- Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it an efficient sorting algorithm.

"Chapter Title: Graph Algorithms and Sorting Techniques

1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph.
- It starts by picking the unvisited vertex with the lowest-distance and calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor.
- If a neighbor's distance is smaller, Dijkstra's algorithm updates the neighbor's distance.
- This process is repeated until all vertices have been visited, resulting in a shortest path tree.

2. Quicksort
- Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm used for sorting large lists.
- It works by dividing a list into two smaller sub-lists: one with low elements and one with high elements.
- The algorithm then recursively sorts the sub-lists and combines them to produce the final sorted list.
- Quicksort's efficiency depends on the choice of the pivot element and can achieve an average time complexity of O(n log n).

3. Heap Sort
- Heap sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a heap data structure.
- It starts by constructing a heap from the given data and repeatedly removing the largest element from the heap.
- The removed elements are then inserted into a sorted array until all elements have been processed, resulting in a sorted array.
- Heap sort has an upper bound time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for sorting large datasets.

4. Radix Sort
- Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm.
- It sorts data by grouping keys based on their individual digits' values and significant positions.
- Radix sort processes the data in passes, each sorting the keys based on a different digit.
- By sorting on each digit, radix sort achieves a linear time complexity for large datasets.

5. FP-growth Algorithm
- The FP-growth algorithm is used for finding frequent patterns in a dataset.
- It consists of two passes: the first pass counts the occurrences of items in the dataset and stores them in a ""header table.""
- The second pass builds the FP-tree structure by inserting instances into the tree.
- The FP-tree is constructed with items sorted in descending order of their frequency, allowing for efficient processing.
- Items that do not meet the minimum coverage threshold are discarded during the tree construction process.

6. Dead Beef
- ""Dead beef"" is a hexadecimal code that serves as an inside joke in the programming community.
- It is often used as a placeholder or test value to ensure that a program has executed a specific part of the code.

- It allows for seamless conversion between SQL and object-oriented programming languages, such as Java or Python.
- By using ORM, developers can work directly with objects in their code, rather than dealing with the complexities of database management.

2. Strongly Typed Languages
- In a strongly typed language, every variable and expression has a specific type.
- This means that you can only perform operations that are valid for its type.
- Strong typing helps catch errors at compile-time and improves code reliability.

3. Merge Sort
- Merge sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that operates on arrays.
- It divides the unsorted list into smaller sublists until each sublist contains only one element.
- It then repeatedly merges the sublists to produce new, sorted sublists, until there is only one sorted list remaining.
- Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it an efficient sorting algorithm.

4. Tail Recursion
- Tail recursion is a concept in programming that applies to recursive functions.
- It allows the calculation of the last product of recursion with less effort.
- However, it's important to note that Python does not fully support tail recursion.

5. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
- SOAP is a protocol that relies on the XML Information Set for its message format.
- It is typically used with other Application Layer protocols, such as HTTP or SMTP, for message negotiation and transmission.
- SOAP enables the exchange of structured information between different systems, making it a powerful tool in distributed computing.

1. Big O Notation
- Big O notation is used to classify algorithms based on how they respond to changes in input size.
- It provides a way to analyze an algorithm's efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.
- By understanding Big O notation, developers can evaluate and compare different algorithms' performance.

2. Netty
- Netty is a non-blocking I/O (NIO) client-server framework used for Java network applications.
- It simplifies network programming, including TCP and UDP socket servers, through its asynchronous event-driven architecture.
- Netty's tools and features make it easier to build efficient and scalable network applications.

3. Node.js
- Node.js is a platform used for building scalable network applications, especially server-side applications.
- It achieves high throughput through its non-blocking I/O and single-threaded event loop.
- Node.js includes a built-in HTTP server library, which eliminates the need for external software like Apache or Lighttpd.

4. Binary Tree
- A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node can have at most two child nodes.
- The child nodes are typically labeled as ""left"" and ""right.""
- Binary trees are widely used in data structures and algorithms due to their efficient search and traversal properties.

5. Balanced Tree
- A balanced tree automatically maintains a small height, even with arbitrary insertions and deletions.
- This property makes balanced trees desirable in situations where efficiency is crucial.
- By keeping the tree balanced, expensive operations can be avoided, resulting in faster processing times.

6. Splay Tree
- A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree.
- It optimizes tree access by making recently accessed elements quick to access again.
- As elements are accessed, the tree adjusts its structure to reduce subsequent search times.

7. Heap
- A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
- The heap property states that if node A is a parent of node B, the key of node A is ordered with respect to the key of node B.
- Heaps are commonly used for efficient priority queue implementations.

8. BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- BFS is a strategy for searching in a graph where the search is limited to two operations: visiting and inspecting a node, and gaining access to visit neighboring nodes.
- It explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., visiting all the vertices at the same ""level"" before moving to deeper levels.

9. DFS (Depth-First Search)
- DFS is an algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
- It starts at the root node (or any selected node in a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- DFS can be implemented recursively or iteratively, and it is useful for various applications such as graph traversal and finding connected components.

10. A* Search
- A* search is an informed search algorithm that traverses a graph by following a path with the lowest expected distance.
- It uses a sorted priority queue to maintain alternate path segments.
- A* search is commonly used in pathfinding problems, such as finding the shortest path in a graph or grid.

Set 3:
Chapter Title: Graph Algorithms and Sorting Techniques

1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph.
- It starts by picking the unvisited vertex with the lowest-distance and calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor.
- If a neighbor's distance is smaller, Dijkstra's algorithm updates the neighbor's distance.
- This process is repeated until all vertices have been visited, resulting in a shortest path tree.

2. Quicksort
- Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm used for sorting large lists.
- It works by dividing a list into two smaller sub-lists: one with low elements and one with high elements.
- The algorithm then recursively sorts the sub-lists and combines them to produce the final sorted list.
- Quicksort's efficiency depends on the choice of the pivot element and can achieve an average time complexity of O(n log n).

3. Heap Sort
- Heap sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a heap data structure.
- It starts by constructing a heap from the given data and repeatedly removing the largest element from the heap.
- The removed elements are then inserted into a sorted array until all elements have been processed, resulting in a sorted array.
- Heap sort has an upper bound time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for sorting large datasets.

4. Radix Sort
- Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm.
- It sorts data by grouping keys based on their individual digits' values and significant positions.
- Radix sort processes the data in passes, each sorting the keys based on a different digit.
- By sorting on each digit, radix sort achieves a linear time complexity for large datasets.

5. FP-growth Algorithm
- The FP-growth algorithm is used for finding frequent patterns in a dataset.
- It consists of two passes: the first pass counts the occurrences of items in the dataset and stores them in a ""header table.""
- The second pass builds the FP-tree structure by inserting instances into the tree.
- The FP-tree is constructed with items sorted in descending order of their frequency, allowing for efficient processing.
- Items that do not meet the minimum coverage threshold are discarded during the tree construction process.

6. Dead Beef
- ""Dead beef"" is a hexadecimal code that serves as an inside joke in the programming community.
- It is often used as a placeholder or test value to ensure that a program has executed a specific part of the code.
- While its actual meaning may vary, it is commonly used to verify program execution in a humorous way.

"Fractional Power:
- Example: Searching in a kd-tree
- Definition: Fractional power refers to the use of non-integer exponents in mathematical operations. In the context of computer science, it can be used in algorithms like searching in a kd-tree, which is a data structure for efficiently storing and searching multidimensional points. Fractional power allows for more precise calculations and improved accuracy in certain applications.

Linear:
- Example: Finding an item in an unsorted list or a malformed tree (worst case) or in an unsorted array
- Definition: Linear refers to the time complexity of an algorithm that increases linearly with the input size. It means that as the input size grows, the execution time or the number of operations required grows at the same rate. For example, finding an item in an unsorted list or array involves checking each element sequentially until a match is found. In the worst case, when the item is not present, the algorithm needs to compare against every element, resulting in a linear time complexity.

Factorial:
- Example: Solving the traveling salesman problem via brute-force search
- Definition: Factorial refers to the mathematical operation of multiplying a sequence of descending natural numbers. In computer science, factorial is often used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms that involve generating all permutations or combinations. For example, solving the traveling salesman problem via brute-force search requires calculating the factorial of the number of cities to determine the total number of possible routes.

Dependency Injection:
- Definition: Dependency injection is a software design pattern that allows the removal of hard-coded dependencies and makes it possible to change them, whether at run-time or compile-time. It involves injecting dependencies (i.e., required objects or services) into a class from an external source, rather than having the class directly create or manage them. By decoupling dependencies, dependency injection promotes modularity, flexibility, and testability in software systems.

Hexadecimal:
- Definition: Hexadecimal refers to the base-16 number system, which consists of 16 unique symbols: the numbers 0 to 9 and the letters A to F. The hexadecimal system is useful in computer science because it can represent every byte (8 bits) as two consecutive hexadecimal digits. It is commonly used in low-level programming, memory addressing, color representation, and network protocols. To convert a value from hexadecimal to binary, each hexadecimal digit is translated into its 4-bit binary equivalent. Hexadecimal numbers are often prefixed with ""0x"" or suffixed with ""h"" for clarity.

Time Units:

"Algorithm:
- Definition: An algorithm is a procedure that consists of a finite set of steps designed to solve a given problem in finite time. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and serves as a blueprint for solving complex computational tasks. Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, such as pseudocode, flowcharts, or programming languages. They play a crucial role in designing efficient and optimized solutions for a wide range of problems.","[Front: Algorithm is a ____, consisting of a ____ set of steps that solves a given problem in ____ time. Back: Algorithm is a procedure, consisting of a finite set of steps that solves a given problem in finite time.]"
"Membership Checks:
- For Lists: Membership checks in lists have a linear time complexity, meaning that the time required to check if an element exists in a list increases proportionally to the size of the list. This involves iterating over the elements until a match is found or reaching the end of the list.
- For Sets: Membership checks in sets have a constant time complexity, indicating that the time required to check if an element exists in a set does not depend on the size of the set. Sets internally use efficient data structures like hash tables or binary search trees to quickly determine membership.

Type Conversion:
- Name: Casting
- Definition: Type conversion, also known as casting, refers to the process of changing the data type of a variable or expression to another compatible type. Casting can be explicit, where the programmer specifically requests the conversion, or implicit, where the language automatically performs the conversion based on the context. It allows for manipulating and combining values of different types, ensuring proper data interactions within a program.","[Front: Membership checks are____ for lists and ______ for sets.

"Imperative Programming:
- Definition: Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state. In imperative programming, the focus is on specifying the steps the computer should take to solve a problem, rather than on describing what the computer will do. Most professional programmers use imperative programming languages like C, C++, Java, COBOL, etc., in their day-to-day jobs due to their versatility and widespread usage.

Weak Reference:
- Definition: A weak reference is a reference that does not protect the referenced object from collection by a garbage collector, unlike a strong reference. In programming languages with automatic memory management, objects referenced only by weak references are considered unreachable or weakly reachable. As a result, they may be collected and memory freed at any time during the execution of a program. Weak references are beneficial in scenarios where you want to hold a reference to an object without preventing its collection when it is no longer needed.

Apache License:
- Definition: The Apache License is a permissive open-source software license that allows users to use, modify, and redistribute the licensed code or derivative works without having to pay royalties or obtain additional permissions. It provides considerable freedom to developers and allows software to be distributed under different licensing terms. The Apache License is widely used in the software industry and supports collaborative development and innovation.

GNU General Public License (GPL):
- Definition: The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a copyleft license designed to guarantee users' freedom to share and change all versions of a program. It ensures that software remains free and accessible to all its users. The GPL allows users to freely distribute and modify software, including charging for it if desired. When combining code licensed under the GPL with other code, the GPL requires the entire work to be licensed under the GPL or a compatible license. GPL binaries must either include the source code or provide a way to download it simultaneously.

"Duck Typing:
Duck typing is a form of polymorphism that does not rely on inheritance. It is based on the principle that if an object walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and acts like a duck, then it can be treated as a duck. In other words, if an object contains the method that is expected to be implemented, it can be considered to be of a specific type.

Jira is a bug tracking system that is widely used in software development. It allows teams to track and manage software-related issues, bugs, and tasks in a collaborative manner. By providing a centralized platform, Jira enables efficient communication and coordination among team members.

Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP):
Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) is a model for parallel computing where processors are connected through a communication network. A BSP computer consists of processors capable of processing and/or local memory transactions, a network for message routing, and a synchronization mechanism for coordinating component activities. BSP allows for efficient parallel processing by dividing computations into supersteps, with synchronization points between each superstep.

MurmurHash:
MurmurHash is a hash function that is suitable for general hash-based lookup. It is known for having a low collision rate, making it particularly useful in scenarios where a random distribution of regular keys is expected. While MurmurHash is not designed for generating unique hashes, occasional collisions can be helpful in certain applications.

Abstraction:
Abstraction is a concept in computer science that involves minimizing the complexity of an entity by hiding its internal details and providing only the relevant information. It allows developers to work with high-level specifications rather than getting bogged down in the implementation details. In the context of cloud computing, for example, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) delivery model abstracts the underlying infrastructure from the user, providing a simplified interface for resource provisioning.

Behaviour Driven Development (BDD):
Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is an approach to software development that combines the principles and techniques of Test Driven Development (TDD), domain-driven design, and object-oriented analysis and design. BDD aims to foster collaboration between software developers and business analysts by providing shared tools and a shared process for delivering valuable software. The focus of BDD is on delivering software that aligns with the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.

Tesla (Time Elapsed Since Labs Attended):
Tesla, in the context of software development, refers to the ""time elapsed since labs attended."" It is a measure of how long it has been since a company's decision-makers (not help desk) last observed a real user interacting with their product or service. The term is typically measured in days, and a low Tesla value indicates that the development team has recently engaged with end users, leading to better understanding and insights for improving the product or service.

JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation:
JIT compilation is a technique used by certain programming languages and runtime environments to improve execution performance. In JIT compilation, code is compiled into machine language during runtime, just before it is executed. This contrasts with ahead-of-time compilation, where code is compiled in advance. JIT compilation can significantly enhance the execution speed of code, making it particularly useful in situations that prioritize performance.

NP-Hard:
NP-Hard refers to problems in computer science that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in the complexity class NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial-time).

"**How to make loops faster**
To make loops faster, extract loop invariants.

**What is faster than function calls**
In-line code is faster than function calls.

**Thrift service**
Thrift service is a simple definition file that defines data types and service interfaces. The compiler then generates code to build RPC clients and servers that can communicate across programming languages. This eliminates the need for writing boilerplate code for serialization, object transport, and remote method invocation. Thrift service is an Apache technology.

**DTD**
DTD stands for Document Type Definition. It is a set of markup declarations that define a document type for a markup language. DTD defines the legal building blocks of an XML document.

**5 S's**
The 5 S's are sort, straighten, shine, standardize, and sustain. Additionally, safety and security can be considered in the 5 S's methodology.

**Honeypot**
A honeypot is a recursive linked website that traps web crawler robots.

**Object Relational Mapper (ORM)**
An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) is a tool that translates SQL tables into object-oriented programming (OOP) objects. An example of an ORM is SQLAlchemy in Python.

**Task queue**
A task queue is a mechanism that allows tasks to be executed asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously (wait until ready). It can be referred to as a job queue. An example of a task queue is Python RQ.

**Instead of describing tasks ...**
Instead of describing tasks procedurally, it is recommended to document the current state and the ideal state. This approach is more declarative as it focuses on describing the state, rather than the steps involved.

**N of M security**
N of M security is an example of key distribution where N secrets are shared among M individuals. To regenerate the original information, any M < N individuals (M of N) are required. This concept is related to Shamir's Secret Sharing. For example, 1 of 5 is low-security, 3 of 5 is medium-security, and 5 of 5 is the highest security.

"**Secondary indexes**
Secondary indexes provide an efficient way to access records in a database by means of some information other than the primary key. While they improve the speed of many read queries, they come with increased storage space and decreased write performance. For example, in a database of students, a secondary index can be created using the last name as the secondary key to look up students.

**CRM**
CRM stands for Customer Resource Management. One example of CRM is Salesforce.

**Advantages of statically typed languages**
Statically typed languages offer two main advantages: speed and safety. Since the compiler has knowledge about the types involved, it can optimize the code better, resulting in faster execution. Additionally, the type system ensures type safety, reducing the chances of runtime errors.

**SDLC** (Systems Development Life Cycle) is a structured approach to software development that encompasses the entire process from initial planning and requirements gathering to the implementation and maintenance of a software system. It consists of different phases, such as requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, and deployment.

**Type safety** refers to the extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents type errors. A type error occurs when there is a discrepancy between data types used in a program, leading to erroneous or undesirable behavior. A programming language with strong type safety helps catch such errors during compilation or runtime.

**Optimizely** is a tool that enables easy A/B testing and MVT (Multivariate Testing) on websites. It allows developers and marketers to experiment with different versions of web properties to determine the most effective design, content, or functionality. This helps optimize the user experience and achieve desired business outcomes.

**Binary search** is a search algorithm that operates on a sorted array. It follows a simple process: 1) Arrange the array in ascending or descending order. 2) Go to the midpoint of the array. 3) Compare the value being searched with the value at the midpoint. 4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 recursively until the value is found, or the search range becomes empty.

A **Doubly Linked List** is a collection of nodes, where each node contains a reference to both the previous and next nodes. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. It is commonly used when elements need to be rapidly added or removed from a list-like data structure.

The **difference between post and put** lies in their use cases. PUT is used to place a file or resource at a specific URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), replacing any existing file or resource at that location. On the other hand, POST sends data to a specific URI and expects the resource at that URI to handle the request in a context-dependent way. Web servers can determine what to do with the data based on the specified resource.

**Lasagna code** refers to a program structure composed of well-defined and separable layers. Each layer of code interacts with the layers below through well-defined interfaces. This design approach allows for modularity, making it easier to understand, maintain, and enhance the software.

"**Conversion rate** refers to the percentage of visits to a website that result in a purchase. It indicates the effectiveness of the website in converting visitors into customers and is a crucial metric for businesses aiming to optimize their online sales.

**Behavior-Based Search** is an algorithmic approach where the search results are influenced by common search patterns and behaviors of users. If a search query is popular and there is a strong correlation between the search and subsequent purchases, the algorithm surfaces relevant items at the top of the results. However, this approach lacks semantic understanding of the search phrase, which is both its strength and weakness.

An **XOR gate** is a fundamental digital logic gate that produces a true output (1/HIGH) if and only if exactly one input is true. It returns false (0/LOW) when both inputs are false or when both inputs are true. The XOR gate's behavior is commonly represented using a truth table.

A **Parity bit** is an extra bit added to a string of binary code to detect errors. It indicates whether the number of bits with the value one in the string is even or odd.

"Title: TCP/IP and its Role in Network Connectivity

TCP/IP is a networking protocol suite that provides end-to-end connectivity by specifying how data should be formatted, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination. It is a fundamental protocol in the internet protocol suite and serves as the foundation for communication over the internet. TCP/IP plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable and efficient transmission of data between devices connected to a network. By defining a set of rules and protocols, TCP/IP enables the establishment of connections, error handling, data segmentation, and reassembly. Its design encompasses various layers, each responsible for specific aspects of communication, ultimately enabling seamless data transfer across networks.","[Front: TCP/IP Back: provides end-to-end connectivity specifying how data should be formatted, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination.]"
"Title: Understanding the Abstraction Layers of TCP/IP

TCP/IP architecture consists of four abstraction layers, each serving a distinct purpose in facilitating communication between devices. These layers are:

1. Link Layer: This layer contains communication technologies for a single network segment, also known as a link. It handles tasks such as data encapsulation, data framing, error detection, and medium access control. The link layer ensures that data can be transmitted reliably between devices connected to the same network segment.

2. Internet Layer: The internet layer connects hosts across independent networks, facilitating packet routing and addressing. It is responsible for logical addressing (IP addressing), packet fragmentation and reassembly, routing protocols, and handling of internet datagrams. The internet layer ensures that data can be sent and received between different networks.

3. Transport Layer: The transport layer handles host-to-host communication and ensures reliable data delivery. It establishes end-to-end connections, manages flow control, and provides error recovery through mechanisms like acknowledgment, retransmission, and sequence numbering. The transport layer guarantees that data can be exchanged between applications running on different devices.

4. Application Layer: The application layer provides process-to-process application data exchange. It encompasses various protocols and services that enable specific applications to communicate over a network. Examples of application layer protocols include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and DNS (Domain Name System).

By dividing the functionality into these abstraction layers, TCP/IP offers a modular and scalable approach to network communication, allowing different components to work independently while ensuring interoperability across devices and networks.","[Front: What are the 4 abstraction layers of TCP/IP?

"Title: Understanding Customer Metrics in Business

In the realm of business and customer relationships, several metrics help evaluate and predict various aspects of customer behavior and financial performance. Three important metrics are as follows:

1. LTV (Life Time Value): LTV is a prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. It calculates the total expected revenue generated from a customer throughout their lifetime as a customer. LTV helps businesses understand the long-term financial worth of acquiring and retaining customers, aiding in decision-making regarding marketing strategies, customer acquisition costs, and customer retention efforts.

2. MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue): MRR refers to the predictable and recurring revenue stream generated by subscription-based business models. It represents the total monthly revenue generated by all active customers or subscriptions. MRR is crucial for businesses operating on a subscription model as it provides insights into revenue stability, growth, and overall business performance.

3. ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue): ARR is similar to MRR but represents the predictable and recurring revenue stream generated over a year instead of a month. It is an essential metric for subscription-based businesses to track and analyze their annual revenue trajectory. ARR is often used to measure business growth, evaluate customer retention efforts, and determine the value generated by the company's subscriptions on an annual basis.

By closely monitoring and analyzing these customer metrics, businesses can make informed decisions, formulate effective strategies, and improve their bottom line.","[Front: LTV Back: Life Time value a prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer.],

"Title: Important Concepts and Tools in Computer Science

1. Right-Associative Operations: Right-associative operations refer to grouping operations from right to left. In this scenario, the operations are evaluated in such a way that the rightmost operation is performed first. For example, in the expression ""x**3,"" the operation exponentiation (raising to the power) is performed first on the variable x. Right-associative operations can be commonly seen in mathematical expressions and programming languages.

2. POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface): POSIX is an acronym for ""Portable Operating System Interface."" It is a set of standards maintained to ensure compatibility between different operating systems. POSIX provides an Application Programming Interface (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility across variants of Unix and other operating systems. It allows developers to write portable and compatible code, reducing the need for reimplementation across different platforms.

3. Big O: Big O notation is a method used to describe the order of complexity of an algorithm. It provides an upper bound estimation of the worst-case scenario regarding time or space complexity. The notation is denoted as ""O(f(n)),"" where ""f(n)"" represents a mathematical function expressing the growth rate of an algorithm concerning the input size ""n."" Big O notation allows computer scientists to analyze algorithms and assess their efficiency, aiding in the selection and comparison of different algorithms.

4. Hyper Log Log: Hyper Log Log is an algorithm utilized in data processing and analysis to estimate the cardinality (the number of unique elements) of a large set with relative accuracy. It achieves this using a single pass over the data and produces an approximate count of unique elements. Hyper Log Log is particularly useful in scenarios where the memory requirements to store the entire set become prohibitively large. By employing probabilistic calculations, it provides an efficient and effective approach to estimating cardinality in large-scale data processing.

5. Insertion Sort: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that operates by iteratively building a sorted output list from an input set of elements. It works by selecting an arbitrary element from the unsorted portion and placing it into the proper position within the sorted list. The process involves comparing the selected element with previously sorted elements and shifting the elements to make space for insertion. Insertion sort repeats this process until no unsorted elements remain. While insertion sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm in terms of time complexity (worst case performance: О(n^2)), it is easy to understand and implement, making it useful for small datasets or as a building block in more complex sorting algorithms.

- Hash Table: A hash table is a data structure that efficiently maps symbols, such as strings, to corresponding values. It uses a hash function to generate a unique hash code for each symbol, which is then used as an index to store and retrieve the associated value. Hash tables provide fast access to data and are commonly used in various computer programs and algorithms, such as in implementing dictionaries or caching.

- Good Heuristic for Hash Table Size: A commonly recommended heuristic for determining the size of a hash table is to choose a large prime number. By using a large prime number as the hash table size, it helps ensure a more uniform distribution of elements across the hash table and reduces the likelihood of collisions, ultimately improving the performance of hash table operations.

- Trick to Reduce Even Hash Look-ups: An approach to reducing collisions and improving performance in hash tables is to ""hash again"" or create hash fingerprints. Instead of directly using the calculated hash code, a secondary hashing operation can be performed on the original hash code to obtain a refined or ""hashed again"" value. This technique helps to further distribute the elements within the hash table, reducing the number of look-ups required.

- Shingling: Shingling is a technique used in natural language processing and information retrieval to summarize each document in a shorter form known as a sketch.

A ""no cloud"" solution refers to the traditional approach of having a computer under your desk that you manage entirely. This includes providing the internet connection, electricity, and managing both the hardware and software aspects of the computer.

The cloud concept really starts with virtual machines (VMs), which are essentially emulated computers running on top of host operating systems. VMs allow users to allocate computing resources efficiently by virtualizing hardware and sharing it among multiple VMs.

At the VM level, users still manage all the software aspects of the virtual machine, such as installing and configuring operating systems, applications, and managing security. However, they are relieved from managing the underlying hardware, which is taken care of by the host operating system.

Containers, or container engines, are a lighter-weight alternative to virtual machines. They create a difference in the filesystem, allowing for shipping around less stuff compared to VMs that need to include the entire operating system. Containers let users focus on their application logic while someone else manages the base OS image and takes care of lower-level sysadmin tasks. Docker is a popular example of a container engine.

Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud computing service model where providers ask you to give them code to run on your behalf. They handle all the other details, such as managing the operating system image, load balancing, and scalability. As a developer or user, you play by the rules and restrictions provided by the PaaS provider without having to worry about infrastructure management.

Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is a component of cloud computing where a company provides access to software applications through an internet connection. Users interact with the software via an API provided by the company, allowing them to utilize the software's functionality without the need for installation or maintenance.","[Front: Record Back: a basic data structure a collection of elements, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. eg: a date could be stored as a record containing a numeric year field, a month field represented as a string, and a numeric day-of-month field.],

Front: What is function composition or nesting? 
Back: Each function receives values from and passes new values back to the calling function. For example: <function1>(<function2>(<function3> ... ) ... ))

Explanation: Function composition, also known as function nesting, involves chaining together multiple functions where each function receives values from the previous function and passes new values to the subsequent function. This allows for the construction of complex computations by combining simpler functions.

- This notation represents a tight bound between two functions. It indicates that function f(n) and g(n) grow at the same rate when n is sufficiently large. The upper bound and lower bound given by c1 · g(n) and c2 · g(n) respectively provide a range within which f(n) falls.

**Any algorithm with n! running time becomes useless for n ≥ 20.**

- As the factorial function grows extremely fast, any algorithm with a running time that scales by n! becomes impractical when n reaches or exceeds 20. This is due to the exponential increase in computation required as n increases.

**Explain this diagram:**
```
    lg is good
    n log n is acceptable
    n! is BAAAAD
```

- This diagram illustrates the favorable growth rates of different functions. The ""lg"" represents logarithmic growth, which is efficient. ""n log n"" represents logarithmic-linear growth, which is still acceptable. However, ""n!"" represents factorial growth, which is highly undesirable due to its exponential nature.

**Algorithms whose running time is 2^n have a greater operating range, but become impractical for n > 40.**

- Algorithms with a running time that grows exponentially with a base of 2 become increasingly impractical as n exceeds 40. The significant increase in computation required makes them inefficient for larger inputs.

**Quadratic-time algorithms whose running time is n^2 remain usable up to about n = 10,000, but quickly deteriorate with larger inputs. They are likely to be hopeless for n > 1,000,000.**

- Algorithms with a running time that grows quadratically with n (n^2) can handle inputs with sizes up to approximately 10,000 efficiently. However, as the input size continues to increase, the performance rapidly declines. These algorithms become impractical for inputs larger than around 1,000,000.

**Linear-time and n log n algorithms remain practical on inputs of one billion items.**

- Algorithms with linear time complexity (n) and logarithmic-linear time complexity (n log n) can handle inputs with sizes up to one billion items efficiently. These algorithms exhibit favorable growth rates that scale well with large inputs.

"**Binary decision diagram (BDD)**

- A binary decision diagram (BDD) is a data structure used to represent and manipulate Boolean functions. It provides an efficient way to store and analyze logical expressions by organizing them into a directed acyclic graph.

**What does functional programming focus on?**

- Functional programming focuses on working with functions and their interactions. It emphasizes the use of pure functions, where the output is solely determined by the input, without side effects. Functional programming avoids mutable variables, loops, and control structures.

**Logic programming**

- Logic programming is based on formal logic. Programs in logic programming are a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Prolog is an example of a logic programming language.

**What is a rough definition of Dynamic Programming?**

- Dynamic programming is a method used when it is easy to express a problem using multiple branches of recursion, but the naive approach of recomputing the same calculations repeatedly becomes inefficient. Dynamic programming solves this issue by breaking down the problem into overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing the results for future use.

**Memoized Recursion**

- Memoized recursion is a technique that involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This technique avoids redundant computation by saving previously computed results. For example, if a factorial function is first invoked with 5 and then later invoked with any value less than or equal to five, the return values will already be memoized.

**Write quicksort in pseudocode**

```plaintext
function quicksort(array)
    less, equal, greater := three empty arrays
    if length(array) > 1
        pivot := select any element of array
        for each x in array
            if x < pivot then add x to less
            if x = pivot then add x to equal
            if x > pivot then add x to greater
        quicksort(less)
        quicksort(greater)
        array := concatenate(less, equal, greater)
```

- This pseudocode represents the QuickSort algorithm. It efficiently sorts an array by recursively partitioning it into three subarrays: elements less than the pivot, elements equal to the pivot, and elements greater than the pivot. The algorithm continues to sort the subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

**Why would you use bitwise operations?**

- Bitwise operations are used in programming for several reasons. They are substantially faster than division, several times faster than multiplication, and sometimes significantly faster than addition. Bitwise operations are commonly used when working with binary data, flags, and bit manipulations for optimization purposes.

**There are two-bit patterns of length 1 - (0 and 1). There are four-bit patterns of length 2 - (00, 01, 10, and 11). How many bits w do we need to represent any one of n different possibilities, be it one of n items or the integers from 1 to n?**

- To represent any one of n different possibilities, we need w = log2 n bits. The key observation is that there must be at least n different bit patterns of length w. Since the number of different bit patterns doubles as you add each bit, we need at least w bits where 2^w = n.

**Write a power function in pseudocode in O(lg n)**

```
(always divide and conquer)
function power(base, exponent)
    if exponent = 0
        return 1
    else if exponent is even
        temp := power(base, exponent / 2)
        return temp * temp
    else
        temp := power(base, (exponent - 1) / 2)
        return base * temp * temp
```

- This pseudocode represents a power function using a divide and conquer approach. The function efficiently calculates the result of raising a base to an exponent in logarithmic time complexity (O(lg n)). It recursively divides the exponent by 2 until it reaches 0, leveraging the fact that (base^a) * (base^a) = base^(2a)","[Front: binary decision diagram (BDD) Back: ],

- Algorithms with a running time that grows quadratically with n (n^2) can handle inputs with sizes up to approximately 10,000 efficiently. However, as the input size continues to increase, the performance rapidly declines. These algorithms become impractical for inputs larger than around 1,000,000.

**Linear-time and n log n algorithms remain practical on inputs of one billion items.**

- Algorithms with linear time complexity (n) and logarithmic-linear time complexity (n log n) can handle inputs with sizes up to one billion items efficiently. These algorithms exhibit favorable growth rates that scale well with large inputs.

**An O(lg n) algorithm hardly breaks a sweat for any imaginable value of n.**

- An algorithm with logarithmic time complexity (O(lg n)) can handle inputs of any imaginable value of n with ease. This notation signifies that the algorithm's efficiency remains high even for large inputs.

Set 3:

**Binary decision diagram (BDD)**

- A binary decision diagram (BDD) is a data structure used to represent and manipulate Boolean functions. It provides an efficient way to store and analyze logical expressions by organizing them into a directed acyclic graph.

**What does functional programming focus on?**

- Functional programming focuses on working with functions and their interactions. It emphasizes the use of pure functions, where the output is solely determined by the input, without side effects. Functional programming avoids mutable variables, loops, and control structures.

**Logic programming**

- Logic programming is based on formal logic. Programs in logic programming are a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Prolog is an example of a logic programming language.

**What is a rough definition of Dynamic Programming?**

- Dynamic programming is a method used when it is easy to express a problem using multiple branches of recursion, but the naive approach of recomputing the same calculations repeatedly becomes inefficient. Dynamic programming solves this issue by breaking down the problem into overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing the results for future use.

**Memoized Recursion**

- Memoized recursion is a technique that involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This technique avoids redundant computation by saving previously computed results. For example, if a factorial function is first invoked with 5 and then later invoked with any value less than or equal to five, the return values will already be memoized.

**Write quicksort in pseudocode**

```plaintext
function quicksort(array)
    less, equal, greater := three empty arrays
    if length(array) > 1
        pivot := select any element of array
        for each x in array
            if x < pivot then add x to less
            if x = pivot then add x to equal
            if x > pivot then add x to greater
        quicksort(less)
        quicksort(greater)
        array := concatenate(less, equal, greater)
```

- This pseudocode represents the QuickSort algorithm. It efficiently sorts an array by recursively partitioning it into three subarrays: elements less than the pivot, elements equal to the pivot, and elements greater than the pivot. The algorithm continues to sort the subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

**Why would you use bitwise operations?**

- Bitwise operations are used in programming for several reasons. They are substantially faster than division, several times faster than multiplication, and sometimes significantly faster than addition. Bitwise operations are commonly used when working with binary data, flags, and bit manipulations for optimization purposes.

**There are two-bit patterns of length 1 - (0 and 1). There are four-bit patterns of length 2 - (00, 01, 10, and 11). How many bits w do we need to represent any one of n different possibilities, be it one of n items or the integers from 1 to n?**

- To represent any one of n different possibilities, we need w = log2 n bits. The key observation is that there must be at least n different bit patterns of length w. Since the number of different bit patterns doubles as you add each bit, we need at least w bits where 2^w = n.

**Write a power function in pseudocode in O(lg n)**

```
(always divide and conquer)
function power(base, exponent)
    if exponent = 0
        return 1
    else if exponent is even
        temp := power(base, exponent / 2)
        return temp * temp
    else
        temp := power(base, (exponent - 1) / 2)
        return base * temp * temp
```

- This pseudocode represents a power function using a divide and conquer approach. The function efficiently calculates the result of raising a base to an exponent in logarithmic time complexity (O(lg n)). It recursively divides the exponent by 2 until it reaches 0, leveraging the fact that (base^a) * (base^a) = base^(2a)","[Front: GPGPUs Back: General-purpose computing on graphics processing units perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the central processing unit (CPU) transfer data from CPU to GPU back to CPU],

"- The semipredicate problem refers to a situation where a subroutine is intended to return a useful value but can fail, and the signaling of failure uses an otherwise valid return value. The caller cannot know what is happening. One way to avoid this problem is by using stdout and stderr to communicate and signal errors, preventing confusion between valid return values and errors.

- In the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture of web applications, the flow of actions can be summarized into four steps. First, a user requests to view a page by entering a URL. Second, the Controller receives the request and processes it. Third, the Controller utilizes the Models, which retrieve the necessary data and organize it. Finally, the View uses the received data to render the final webpage, which is then presented to the user in their browser.

- Routes, in the context of MVC frameworks, are URL patterns associated with different pages. When a user enters a URL, the application compares it with predefined routes to determine which controller and action (function) should handle the request. Each route is associated with a controller action, allowing for proper routing of requests to the appropriate parts of the application.

- Painkillers and vitamins are two different approaches to addressing customer needs. Painkillers are focused on solving a specific pain or problem that customers experience, targeting a quantifiable market.

"- The hook method for products refers to the steps involved in creating habit-forming experiences. Triggers play a significant role in cueing these habits, whether they are external triggers (such as buttons) or internal triggers (such as emotions or routines). The action phase of the hook involves performing the simplest behavior in anticipation of a reward. Variable rewards keep users engaged by giving them what they came for but leaving them wanting more. The investment phase encourages users to contribute something to the service, increasing the likelihood of future usage.

- Contiguously-allocated structures are composed of single slabs of memory. Examples include arrays, matrices, heaps, and hash tables. They utilize contiguous memory locations to store data, ensuring efficient access and manipulation.

- Linked data structures, such as lists, trees, and graph adjacency lists, consist of distinct chunks of memory connected through pointers. Pointers represent the addresses of memory locations, creating relationships between different elements of the structure.

- Arrays offer several advantages as a data structure. Firstly, they provide constant-time access based on the index, allowing for instant retrieval of data when the index is known. Secondly, arrays exhibit efficient usage of space since they consist only of data, without links or formatting information. Finally, arrays demonstrate excellent memory locality, enabling efficient utilization of the high-speed cache memory in modern computer architectures.

- Pointers are the connections that hold the pieces of linked structures together. They represent the addresses of memory locations, allowing for traversal and manipulation of linked elements.

"- Retrieving the item with the largest or smallest key from a dictionary can be seen as transforming it into a priority queue. The priority queue allows elements to be added and removed based on their associated keys, with higher or lower priority items being given precedence.

- Choosing the wrong data structure for a particular task can have disastrous performance implications. It is crucial to identify the most suitable data structure, considering factors such as efficiency, memory usage, and the specific requirements of the problem at hand. In some cases, there may be multiple data structures with similar performance, making the decision less critical.

- A vantage-point tree is a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree used to segregate data in a metric space. It involves selecting a position in the space, known as the vantage point, and dividing the data points into two partitions. The first partition includes points that are nearer to the vantage point than a given threshold, while the second partition consists of points that are not.","[Front: Retrieve the item with the largest (or smallest) key from dictionary turns it into a ______ Back: priority queue.],

Let α be the size of the alphabet on which a given string S is written. Let char(c) be a function that maps each symbol of the alphabet to a unique integer from 0 to α − 1. The function maps each string to a unique (but large) integer by treating the characters of the string as ""digits"" in a base-α number system.

2. Mapping Keys to Integers
The first step of the hash function is usually to map each key to a big integer. This is done to ensure that the hash function can handle any size of input and produce a unique output for each key.

3. GUIs and Hashing
Globally unique identifiers (GUIs) are generated using random numbers and are commonly stored as 128-bit values. They are often displayed as 32 hexadecimal digits with groups separated by hyphens. The probability of one duplicate GUI would be about 50% if every person on Earth as of 2014 owned 600 million GUIDs. GUIs use hashing techniques to ensure their uniqueness.

4. MurmurHash
MurmurHash is a general hash-based lookup that is simple, very fast, and collision resistant. It is a non-cryptographic hash function that is commonly used in various applications.

5. Avalanche Effect
The avalanche effect refers to the property of a hash function where a small change in the input results in a significant change in the output. This property is desirable in cryptographic algorithms as it adds security by making it difficult to predict the output given the input.","[Front: Write the forumla for a hash function Back: Let α be the size of the alphabet on which a given string S is written.

"Chapter: State Machine Replication

1. State Machine Replication Principle
The principle of state machine replication states that if two identical, deterministic processes begin in the same state and receive the same inputs in the same order, they will produce the same output and end in the same state. This principle is foundational in ensuring the consistency of replicated systems.","[Front: State Machine Replication Principle Back: If two identical, deterministic processes begin in the same state and get the same inputs in the same order, they will produce the same output and end in the same state.]"
"Chapter: Hash Functions and Hashing Techniques

1. General Formula for a Hash Function
A hash function typically involves the bytewise iteration over a key, where some internal state is mixed up with the key bits using a combination of ANDs, ORs, XORs, ADDs, shifts, magic numbers, and modular arithmetic. This process helps generate a unique hash value for the given key.

2. Angle Brackets in Markup Languages
Angle brackets (< >) are commonly used in markup languages like HTML to denote tags or elements. They serve as indicators for the start and end of an element and play a crucial role in specifying the structure and formatting of content.

3. Hash Tables
If there is only one data structure available, it is recommended to make it a hash table. Hash tables provide efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval by using a hash function to compute the index for each key. This allows for fast access to data based on its key.

4. XPath
XPath is a language used for selecting nodes in XML documents. It can also be used with HTML. XPath expressions enable the traversal and querying of hierarchical data structures like XML and HTML documents.

5. Separate Chaining in Hashing
Separate chaining is a collision resolution technique in hashing. In this approach, each key is hashed to a specific bucket. If two keys are hashed to the same bucket, a separate linked list (or an intermediate list) is used to store them. If a collision occurs again, the second key is moved to a different location to maintain the integrity of the hash table.

6. Open Addressing in Hashing
Open addressing is another collision resolution technique in hashing. In this approach, all entry records are stored in the bucket array itself. When a new entry needs to be inserted, the buckets are examined starting from the hashed-to slot and following a probe sequence until an unoccupied slot is found. This allows for efficient utilization of storage space.","[Front: What is the general formula for a hash function?

"Chapter: Idempotence, HATEOAS, and the Richardson Maturity Model

1. Idempotence
Idempotence refers to the property of an operation that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. In other words, performing the operation once or multiple times produces the same outcome. This property is useful in various scenarios to ensure the predictability and reliability of actions.

2. HATEOAS
HATEOAS stands for ""Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State."" It is an architectural constraint of RESTful systems where hypertext links are used to navigate and interact with the API. HATEOAS allows clients to discover and understand the available actions and resources within an API without prior knowledge.

3. Richardson Maturity Model
The Richardson Maturity Model is a conceptual model that defines different levels of maturity for building RESTful APIs. The model consists of four levels:
- Level 0: Swamp of POX - No use of HTTP, mimicking remote procedure call (RPC) style communication.
- Level 1: Resources - Use of HTTP verbs to interact with resources.
- Level 2: HTTP verbs - Additional use of appropriate HTTP verbs and status codes for more precise API interactions.
- Level 3: Hypermedia Controls - Use of hypermedia links to provide navigational information within the API.

4. Hash Functions and Hash Table Size
When a hash function generates unique identifier numbers for a hash table that exceed the number of slots available, it is necessary to reduce this number to an integer between 0 and m−1. This is achieved by taking the remainder of the hash value mod m, where m is the number of slots in the hash table. Ideally, m should be a large prime number that is not too close to 2^i − 1, ensuring better distribution and reduced collisions.

5. Rabin-Karp Algorithm
The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string searching algorithm that uses a hash function to compute the hash value of patterns and the text being searched. It employs a rolling hash mechanism, where the previous hash value is used to compute the next hash value, thereby speeding up the search process. Collisions are handled by performing a full compare on the hash match to avoid false positives.

6. Suffix Trees
A suffix tree is a trie-like data structure that contains all the suffixes of a given set of strings. It is used for efficient pattern matching or substring search operations. Suffix trees provide a compact representation of a set of strings, enabling fast search and retrieval based on suffixes.

7. Currying
Currying is the process of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. This technique allows for partial application of functions and provides flexibility in modifying and reusing code","[Front: What is idempotence?

"Textbook Notes: Programming Concepts

1. Partial Evaluation and the Iteration Theorem:
For a given programming language and positive integers m and n, there is a particular algorithm that operates on the source code of programs with m + n free variables. This algorithm is known as partial evaluation. Partial evaluation is also referred to as the iteration theorem, and it provides a theoretical premise for optimizing program execution.

2. Currying:
Currying is a concept in functional programming where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows for the partial application of arguments, creating new functions with fewer arguments. Currying provides increased flexibility and composability in function composition.

3. Heapsort:
Heapsort is an implementation of the selection sort algorithm using a binary heap as the underlying data structure. It works by building a max-heap or min-heap (depending on the desired sorting order) and repeatedly extracting the root element. Heapsort has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is particularly efficient for large datasets.

4. Heap-labeled Tree:
A heap-labeled tree is a binary tree where each node is labeled with a key value. The key labeling of each node dominates the key labeling of each of its children. This property allows efficient operations in a heap-based data structure.

5. Heap Data Structure:
The heap is a data structure that enables us to represent binary trees without using any pointers. Instead, we store data as an array of keys and use the position of the keys to implicitly satisfy the role of the pointers. The heap data structure allows efficient insertions, deletions, and other heap-specific operations.

6. Heapify:
Heapify is the process of maintaining the heap property after the removal of a node or the insertion of a new key. It involves the percolate-down operation that bubbles down the dissatisfied element until it dominates all its children, perhaps by becoming a leaf node and ceasing to have any.

7. Mergesort Pseudocode:
Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides the input array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them together. Here is the pseudocode for mergesort:

function mergeSort(arr):
    if length(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    mid = length(arr) / 2
    left = mergeSort(arr[0:mid])
    right = mergeSort(arr[mid:])

    return merge(left, right)

function merge(left, right):
    result = []

    while length(left) > 0 and length(right) > 0:
        if left[0] <= right[0]:
            result.append(left[0])
            left = left[1:]
        else:
            result.append(right[0])
            right = right[1:]

    result.extend(left)
    result.extend(right)

    return result

8. Quicksort:
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around the pivot. It creates a low pile containing all the elements that appear before the pivot in sorted order and a high pile containing all the elements that appear after the pivot in sorted order. Quicksort recursively sorts the low and high piles. Quicksort has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n) and is widely used due to its efficiency.

9. N-Tier Architectures:
N-Tier architectures are a client-server architecture with logically separate processes. It consists of three tiers: the presentation tier, the application processing tier, and the data management tier. Each tier has its own set of responsibilities and communicates with the other tiers through well-defined interfaces. N-Tier architectures promote modular and scalable software development.","[Front:  Back: for a given programming language and positive integers m and n, there is a particular algorithm that operates on the source code of programs with m + n free variables the theoretical premise for partial evaluation aka, iteration theorem],

It is associative and commutative, making it suitable for counting distinct elements in large data sets without storing the actual elements. HyperLogLog achieves high accuracy with low memory requirements and provides estimations for read, write, and error rates.

3. Uniform Access Principle:
The Uniform Access Principle states that all services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation that does not reveal whether they are implemented through storage or computation. The principle advocates for treating attributes, precomputed properties, methods, and queries uniformly by providing a consistent interface for accessing them. This enhances code maintainability and flexibility.

4. Nuts & Bolts:
The Nuts & Bolts problem involves matching a collection of n bolts and n nuts with different widths. Each nut can be tested to determine whether it fits a particular bolt, indicating whether it is too large, too small, or an exact match. The problem aims to match each bolt with its corresponding nut efficiently. The solution involves using a pivot element, sorting the bolts and nuts accordingly, and performing a comparison between them.

5. Bucketsort:
Bucketsort is a sorting algorithm that works well with uniformly distributed data. It involves dividing the input into multiple buckets based on certain criteria, such as the first letter or a specific digit. Each bucket is then further sorted individually. Bucketsort provides efficient sorting for specific scenarios where the data distribution is known in advance.

6. Winning at 20 Questions:
Winning at 20 Questions involves applying a binary search strategy using a dictionary of words. The goal is to guess a word by asking a series of questions, with each split narrowing down the search space. With 20 splits, it is possible to find the target word by asking whether it is higher or lower than a particular word. This approach leverages the power of binary search to guess the word efficiently.

"Divide and conquer algorithm is a problem-solving approach based on multi-branched recursion. It recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type until they become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. This algorithm is commonly used in various applications such as sorting (e.g., quicksort, merge sort), multiplying large numbers (e.g. Karatsuba), syntactic analysis (e.g., top-down parsers), and computing the discrete Fourier transform (FFTs).

Greedy algorithm, on the other hand, follows a locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. While this may not always result in the best solution, it often provides a good enough and quick solution. One example is determining the minimum number of coins to give while making change.

Backtracking is a technique used to find all (or some) solutions to computational problems. It incrementally builds candidates to the solutions and abandons each partial candidate as soon as it determines that it cannot be completed to a valid solution. Backtracking works well in constraint satisfaction problems, such as solving the eight queens puzzle, which asks for all arrangements of eight chess queens on a standard chessboard so that no queen attacks any other.

Coase theorem is a concept that states, when property rights are involved, parties naturally gravitate toward the most efficient and mutually beneficial outcome. It suggests that high transaction costs tend to favor insourcing, whereas low transaction costs tend to favor outsourcing.

Trapdoor function is a function used in cryptography that is easy to compute in one direction but difficult to compute in the opposite direction (finding its inverse) without special information. This property makes trapdoor functions useful for creating secure encryption systems.","[Front: Divide and conquer algorithm Back: based on multi-branched recursion recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.

Best-first search is a graph search algorithm that orders all partial solutions (states) according to some heuristic. This heuristic attempts to predict how close a partial solution is to a complete solution (goal state).

Front: best method to sort files into groups
Back: file_id mod n_groups

Definition: The best method to sort files into groups can be achieved by using the modulo operator (%), where the file_id (a unique identifier for each file) is divided by the number of groups (n_groups) and the remainder determines the group assigned to the file. This approach ensures a balanced distribution of files among the specified number of groups.

Usage: When categorizing files into groups, using the file_id modulo n_groups method allows for an efficient and even distribution of files, avoiding any bias or uneven grouping","[Front: Explain how to use Dynamic Programming to make change.

"QRP (low power) operation refers to the practice of transmitting data at reduced power while attempting to maximize the effective range. By optimizing various factors such as antenna design and propagation conditions, QRP operators aim to achieve longer distance communication despite operating with lower power levels.

Applicative state transition systems are computational models where computation and update are separated. Programs are interpreted as defining functions over states, and the update follows successful computation of new states. This approach allows for more modular and flexible program design.

Array is a fixed-size collection of elements, each identified by an array index. Accessing an element in an array is done in constant time, given the index, which makes it an efficient data structure for random access. However, searching requires linear time complexity.

Vector is similar to an array but allows for resizing. It is essentially a dynamic array that can grow or shrink as needed. Accessing an element in a vector is also done in constant time, but search, insertion, and deletion operations have linear time complexity due to the need for resizing and shifting elements.

Singly linked list is a data structure composed of nodes that form a sequence. Each node contains a data element and a reference (pointer) to the node ahead of it. Singly linked lists are commonly used to implement lists, queues, and stacks. However, they do not allow random access like arrays or vectors, resulting in linear time complexity for accessing, searching, insertion, and deletion operations.","[Front: QRP operation Back: transmitting at reduced power while attempting to maximize one's effective range],

"Doubly linked list is a linked list where each node contains a reference (pointer) both to the node ahead and behind it. This additional reference allows for more flexibility in traversing the list in both directions. Similar to singly linked lists, doubly linked lists have linear time complexity for accessing, searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array or a key-value store. It uses a hash function to compute a key/index, which corresponds to an array of buckets or slots where the value of the element can be found. Hash tables offer constant time complexity for accessing, searching, insertion, and deletion operations, depending on the load factor.

Tree is a data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure using linked nodes. It consists of a root node and subtrees of children nodes. Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships and provide efficient searching and sorting capabilities. Binary search trees, a type of tree, have logarithmic time complexity for accessing, searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Graph is a data structure consisting of a finite set of nodes or vertices connected by edges or arcs. Graphs are used to represent complex relationships between entities and can model various real-world scenarios. Adjacency list, a common representation of graphs, offers efficient storage and operations with time complexity dependent on the number of vertices and edges.

DEFLATE is widely used in various applications to achieve high compression ratios.

Jim Gray, a renowned database researcher, used an analogy to describe different levels of data accessibility. He compared accessing data on the processor to accessing information from our head, where the retrieval is quick and efficient. In contrast, accessing data in RAM is likened to driving from Berkeley to Sacramento, taking around 1.5 hours. Finally, accessing data on disk is equivalent to a long space shuttle trip to Pluto, taking two years. This comparison emphasizes the substantial time difference between different storage media.

Double, also known as the double-precision type, is a floating-point data type that occupies 8 bytes (64 bits) in computer memory. It provides a wide dynamic range and increased precision compared to regular floating-point types, using more memory. Double relies on the fact that it uses twice as many bits as a regular floating-point number, enabling the representation of a broader range of values. The range of values and their representation in double format is explained with various examples.

TOOWTDI, short for ""There's Only One Way To Do It,"" refers to a programming philosophy, popularized by the Python community, which advocates for having only one correct way to solve a problem. This philosophy promotes simplicity, readability, and maintainability by discouraging excessive complexity and multiple approaches to achieving the same result.

Neural Turing Machines extend the abilities of neural networks by coupling them to external memory resources. This coupling allows neural networks to interact with memory through attentional processes. The combined system resembles a Turing Machine or Von Neumann architecture while being differentiable end-to-end. Neural Turing Machines have shown promising results in inferring simple algorithms such as copying, sorting, and associative recall.

""When in doubt, use brute force"" is a saying attributed to Ken Thompson, highlighting the effectiveness of brute force approaches in solving a problem when unsure of a more efficient solution. Brute force refers to solving a problem by exhaustively checking all possible solutions, even though it may not be the most optimized or elegant approach.

Map is a higher-order function that applies a given function to each element of a list, returning a new list containing the results. It can be considered as the functional form of ""apply-to-all."" The map function enables concise and expressive programming by abstracting away repetitive iteration over a list.

"Title: Data Formats and Database Operations

Flashcard 1:
Front: A byte is how many bits?
Back: 8

Explanation:
A byte is a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits. It is the basic building block for storing and manipulating data in most computer systems.

Flashcard 2:
Front: What is the size of a binary decision?
Back: 0.1 bytes

Explanation:
A binary decision, representing a choice between two options, requires 0.1 bytes of storage. It represents a minimal amount of information needed to store a true/false or yes/no decision.

Flashcard 3:
Front: XML format
Back: More of a document data format than a structured data format

Explanation:
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language commonly used for transmitting and storing structured data. However, it is often considered more suitable for representing documents and hierarchical data rather than highly structured data.

Flashcard 4:
Front: DataFrame definition
Back: A collection of rows organized into named columns

Explanation:
A DataFrame is a data structure used in various programming languages and data analysis libraries. It is designed to organize data into a tabular format, where rows represent individual records, and columns represent different attributes or variables of the data.

Flashcard 5:
Front: Traditional database operations
Back: 1. Define 2. Load 3. Do

Explanation:
Traditional database operations typically involve three steps:
1. Define: Establish the schema and structure of the database.
2. Load: Populate the database with data by inserting records.
3. Do: Perform various operations on the database, such as querying, updating, or deleting data.

Flashcard 6:
Front: Schema-before-write approach
Back: Technically, it's not even schema-on-write; it's schema-before-write

Explanation:
The schema-before-write approach refers to the practice of enforcing a strict schema or data structure before allowing data to be written into a system. This approach contrasts with schema-on-write, where data can be written without a predefined schema.

Flashcard 7:

"**Template Matching** is a technique that uses a 'template', or model, of the object we want to find (in probability parlance this is called a prior), and then scans an image to see if any part of it is similar to the template. This scanning process is technically known as **cross correlation**. Cross correlation compares two sets of data and returns a measure of how similar they are. If the two sets of data are the same, the cross correlation is 1, but if they are completely different, the cross correlation is 0.

**Garbage collection** is a type of problem that involves a **graph search** for unreachable data structures. It refers to the automatic memory management process in programming languages where the system automatically deallocates memory that is no longer in use.

In microservice architectures, a **bounded context** encapsulates all internal details of a specific domain and has explicit integration points with other bounded contexts. It also serves as a physical context. It helps in maintaining the separation of concerns and modularity in a distributed system.

**MTTR** (Mean Time To Repair) and **MTBF** (Mean Time Between Failure) are both important metrics used to measure the reliability and availability of a system. MTTR represents the average time it takes to repair a component or system after a failure, while MTBF represents the average time between two consecutive failures.

To guarantee finding the poisoned bottle among a thousand bottles of wine with only 10 mice to test, we can encode the wine bottle numbers in binary and assign each mouse a combination based on this table. By observing which mice die after consuming the wine, we can determine the poisoned bottle. This system allows for encoding up to 24 additional bottles.

Sturgeon's law states that ""ninety percent of everything is crap."" This observation is often applied to various fields, indicating that the majority of output or content is of low quality.","[Front: template matching Back: uses a ‘template’, or model, of the object we want to find (in probability parlance this is called a prior), and then scans an image to see if any part of it is similar to the template.],

"**Average-case runtime** refers to the average of how long it would take an algorithm to run if it were given all possible inputs. It is a measure of algorithmic efficiency and provides insights into the expected performance under different scenarios.

The runtime for common Big O notation, if N equals 100, cannot be determined without knowing the specific algorithm being analyzed. However, Big O notation provides an upper bound on the runtime complexity as the input size grows large.

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** takes O(E * V * Log(V)) time to find the best route. Here, E represents the number of road segments, and V represents the number of intersections. It is a popular graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.

Dijkstra's Algorithm requires a **priority queue** data structure to efficiently manage the order in which vertices are explored. A priority queue allows accessing and removing elements with the highest priority (usually the smallest value) efficiently.

If you have N employees and M jobs that need to be done, but not every employee can do every job, the **max flow algorithm** can help in determining how to assign the employees to the jobs in such a way that every job gets done, provided it is possible.

To find the differences between two sequences, we can calculate the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and edits required to transform sequence A into sequence B. This can be achieved using dynamic programming in O(N * M) time, where N and M are the numbers of elements in the two sequences.

In some programming languages, there are **primitives** that represent non-object data types. For example, in languages like Python and Scala, everything is an object, but there are still basic non-object data types available for use.

**Timsort** is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. It is designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data.

"A network and protocol stack can be visually represented as a **diagram** showing the different layers of the protocol stack and the corresponding network components involved in the communication process.

**ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a protocol used to perform many network 'housekeeping' tasks. It is primarily utilized for diagnostic and error reporting purposes in IP-based networks.

**UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that represents a lightweight method of sending and receiving data. It provides fast and efficient data exchange but does not guarantee delivery or order of packets.

**TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol. It establishes a reliable and secure data transfer mechanism with features like acknowledgments, flow control, and congestion control. TCP ensures that data is delivered correctly and in the correct order.

When comparing UDP and TCP, UDP requires manual handling of the opening, closing, and acknowledgment processes, while TCP is highly efficient and includes mechanisms like windowing to provide fast network performance and adaptive feedback.

Sorting an array of N elements takes O(Nlog(N)) time. The time complexity is proportional to the product of the number of elements and the logarithm of the number of elements.

Finding an element in a sorted array takes O(log(N)) time. The time complexity is logarithmic as the search space is halved with each comparison.

The **>>** operator is the arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. It shifts the bits of a binary number to the right, discarding the rightmost bits and filling the leftmost bits with the sign bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative numbers).

The **>>>** operator is the logical (or unsigned) right shift operator. It shifts the bits of a binary number to the right, discarding the rightmost bits and filling the leftmost bits with zeroes, regardless of the sign of the number.","[Front: Draw network and protocol stack Back: ],

Set 4 covers topics related to computer vision, data structures, database concepts, and encoding techniques. The first flashcard discusses ""Scale space,"" which is a framework for representing multi-scale signal structures in computer vision and image processing. Scale space allows handling image structures at different scales by representing an image as a one-parameter family of smoothed images.

The second flashcard introduces ""Consistent hashing,"" a specific type of hashing that minimizes key remapping when resizing hash tables. This technique ensures that on average, only a fraction of keys need to be remapped during resizing, improving efficiency.

The flashcard mentioning ""At least once"" and ""At most once"" errors refers to potential issues in distributed systems. These errors relate to the guarantee of message delivery in such systems, indicating that a message may be delivered either at least once or at most once, but not necessarily exactly once.

The flashcards further discuss database-related concepts such as ""Database Object,"" which refers to a data structure used to store or reference data. The most common database object is a table, but other objects like indexes, stored procedures, sequences, and views are also included.

The concept of a ""Composite Key"" is introduced as a combination of two or more columns in a table that can uniquely identify each row. While individual columns may not guarantee uniqueness, their combination ensures unique identification, such as using a combination of a student and a class to prevent duplicate enrollments.

Lastly, the flashcards cover ""delta encoding,"" which involves storing the differences (deltas) between sequential values instead of the values themselves. Delta encoding is useful for reducing storage size, especially when dealing with byte values, such as code changes and timestamps.

The flashcard mentioning ""prefiex coding"" refers to delta encoding specifically designed for strings when regular dictionary encoding is not applicable. Prefiex coding utilizes delta encoding techniques to minimize storage requirements for string representations.

"Flashcard 1:
Front: Modulo-division Method
Back: The modulo-division method is a simple hashing algorithm used for addressing elements in an array. The key is divided by the size of the array (table size), and the remainder is used as the address. For example, the address for a key can be calculated as 'address = key MODULUS tableSize'.",[Front: modulo-division method Back: divides the key by array size (table size) and uses the remainder for the address eg: the simple hashing algorithm shown below where tableSize is the number of elements in the array. address = key MODULUS tableSize]
"Flashcard 1:
Front: Why do you want a prime table size for addressing?
Back: Using the modulo-division method, addressing elements with a prime table size produces fewer collisions than other table sizes. Collisions occur when two different keys generate the same address. By choosing a prime table size, the distribution of addresses is more evenly spread, reducing collisions and improving the efficiency of address resolution.

Back: The Fermi problem is an estimation problem designed to teach dimensional analysis, approximation, and the importance of clearly identifying one's assumptions. It commonly involves questions like ""How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?"" where the goal is to arrive at a reasonable estimation using logical reasoning and approximations.

Flashcard 3:
Front: Paging out to Disk
Back: When a program utilizes more physical memory than is available, the operating system moves some of its data to secondary storage, ensuring that the system never runs out of memory. This process is known as paging out to disk, and the portion of the hard disk acting as physical memory is called a page file.

Flashcard 5:
Front: Asynchronous
Back: Asynchronous refers to operations or events that do not occur or exist at the same time. In the context of computing, it specifically relates to communication between a client and a service. When processing a request asynchronously, the service executes the request at an arbitrary point in time, sometime after it has been transmitted from the client. Asynchronous processing allows the client to continue its execution without directly observing or synchronizing with the service's execution.

Flashcard 6:
Front: Execute Typical Instruction

"Recursion requires two essential components: a base case and a recursive call. A recursive algorithm must have a base case, which represents the stop condition for the recursion. Additionally, the algorithm must call itself to change its state and move closer to the base case.
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding solutions to computational problems, especially constraint satisfaction problems. It incrementally builds candidates for solutions and abandons each partial candidate as soon as it determines that it cannot lead to a valid solution. Examples of problems that can be solved using backtracking include the eight queens puzzle and Sudoku solvers.
The Queens Problem involves placing n queens on an n by n chessboard without any of the queens threatening each other. The solution space is the Cartesian product of {1, 2, 3, ..., n} with itself, and the backtracking algorithm can record the columns where the different queens are positioned.

1. Property-Based Testing Framework: A property-based testing framework allows us to run the same test over and over again with generated input. The input is usually random within a specified range. This type of testing contrasts with example-based testing, which is typically used in unit testing.

2. Huffman Code: Huffman code is an optimal prefix code that is used for lossless data compression. It allows frequent items to be encoded using fewer bits, thus reducing the overall size of the data.

3. Huffman Tree: In Huffman encoding, a Huffman tree is built using a set of symbols and their weights, which are usually proportional to probabilities. The goal is to find a prefix-free binary code (a set of codewords) with the minimum expected codeword length. The inner nodes of the Huffman tree always contain binary values.

4. Class: A class represents ""data with operations attached."" It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming and allows us to encapsulate data and define behaviors (operations) that can be performed on that data.

5. Closure: A closure represents ""operations with data attached."" It emphasizes immutability and pure functions. Closures are commonly used in functional programming to encapsulate behavior along with the data it operates on.

6. Classes Emphasize Mutable State: Classes in object-oriented programming tend to emphasize mutable or rebindable state. This means that the state of an object can be modified after its creation, leading to potential side effects and mutable behavior.

7. Closures Emphasize Immutability: On the other hand, closures in functional programming emphasize immutability and pure functions. Immutable data and pure functions help promote safer and less error-prone code.

8. Bellman Equation for Dynamic Programming: The Bellman equation is a key concept in dynamic programming. It involves planning for every path by first calculating the minimum cost to reach the current node from the goal node. Then, working forwards, the algorithm greedily picks the node with the minimum cost. This iterative process helps find optimal solutions in problems that can be decomposed into smaller subproblems.

9. Cache Performance and CPU: This flashcard explains the relationship between cache and CPU performance. The closer the cache is to the CPU, the faster it is but also smaller in size. There are multiple levels of cache (L1, L2, L3) with varying sizes and speeds.

It allows developers to build concurrent and distributed systems by creating lightweight actors that communicate with each other through messages. Actors can change their behavior dynamically based on the received messages, enabling flexible and scalable systems.

- What are Unicode characters divided into?
Unicode characters are divided into eight-bit sets called planes. The first 256 planes are known as the basic multilingual plane. Each plane can represent additional characters and symbols.

Dynamic Programming is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller overlapping subproblems. It solves each subproblem only once and stores the results to avoid recomputation, leading to more efficient solutions.

- How does Dynamic Programming handle map and goal inputs?
In Dynamic Programming, given a map and a goal, the technique calculates the best path from any location to reach the goal. It does this by recursively building the value function for every step and considering all possible paths. The output is the best path based on the calculated values.

- How are Floating-Point numbers represented?
Floating-Point numbers are represented using a 32-bit format, which compromises between the size of the mantissa and the size of the exponent. The representation allows for a wide range of real numbers but sacrifices precision.","[Front: Dynamic Programming. What is given? What is the output? How?

"- What type of problem is Set Cover?
Set Cover is an NP-hard problem, which means it is computationally challenging to find the optimal solution within a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, approximations are often used to find a small but not necessarily the smallest solution.

- What is an algorithm to find the shortest path between two points?
Dynamic Programming can be used to find the shortest path between two points. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, the algorithm calculates the optimal path considering all intermediate points.

- What is an algorithm to find the smallest set of objects that satisfies certain criteria?
Dynamic Programming can also be used to find the smallest set of objects that satisfy specific criteria. The algorithm breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems and recursively combines solutions to find the optimal set.

- What is the Clear Web?
The Clear Web, also known as the surface web, refers to the part of the web that is indexed and accessible through search engines like Google. It includes websites that are publicly available and can be accessed by anyone.

- What encoding is required to store a Unicode string on disk?
To store a Unicode string on disk, an encoding needs to be picked. Examples of encodings include UTF-8, ASCII, and Latin-1. The choice of encoding determines how the Unicode characters are represented and stored.

- What is UTF-8?
UTF-8 is an encoding that allows the representation of all Unicode characters while looking like ASCII text to Americans. It is a variable-length encoding scheme where different characters may require different numbers of bytes to store.","[Front: Set cover is a _______ problem, so use _________ approach that finds a ______________.

"- Given bytes that hold text, can you determine the encoding for sure?
No, when given bytes that hold text, it is not possible to determine the encoding for sure without additional information. The encoding could be anything, but UTF-8 is a common choice for text encoding, especially on the web.

- What is the Graham scan algorithm?
The Graham scan algorithm is a method used to find the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane. The algorithm involves several steps, such as finding the point with the lowest y-coordinate, sorting the points based on their angles with the x-axis, and determining whether each set of points constitutes a left or right turn. The time complexity of the Graham scan algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of points.

If a right turn, the second-to-last point is not part of the convex hull, and lies 'inside' it. The same determination is then made for the set of the latest point and the two points that immediately precede the point found to have been inside the hull, and is repeated until a ""left turn"" set is encountered, at which point the algorithm moves on to the next point in the set of points in the sorted array minus any points that were found to be inside the hull]"
"1. Heapsort is an improved selection sort algorithm that divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region. It iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving it to the sorted region.

2. A fluent interface is an implementation of an object-oriented API that aims to provide more readable code. It allows chaining of methods on an object. For example:
   ```

           self.content = content
       def indent(self, spaces):

4. NUX stands for New User Experience.

5. Metaprogramming is the act of changing program behavior at runtime. It involves modifying or generating code based on certain conditions or requirements.

6. Raft is a consensus algorithm for maintaining replicated state across a collection of machines. It achieves consensus via an elected leader. A server in a Raft cluster can be a leader, a candidate, or a follower. The leader is responsible for log replication to the followers. It regularly informs the followers of its existence by sending a heartbeat message. Each follower has a timeout and expects to receive the heartbeat from the leader within a specific time frame. If no heartbeat is received, the follower changes its status to a candidate and starts a new leader election process.

7. Two characteristics of a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming are overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. Overlapping subproblems refer to the fact that the solution to a problem can be computed by solving smaller overlapping subproblems, avoiding redundant calculations. Optimal substructure means that the optimal solution to the problem can be obtained by combining the optimal solutions to its subproblems.

8. The difference between dynamic programming and recursion is that recursion starts with a large problem and solves nested subproblems to build a solution. On the other hand, dynamic programming starts with a subproblem and builds overlapping solutions. During recursion, there may exist a case where the same subproblems are solved multiple times. Dynamic programming, however, uses memoization to store the results of subproblems in a table, allowing for direct retrieval instead of recalculating the same subproblem.","[Front: What is heapsort?

Probalistic programming is a language with random primitives that enable backwards reasoning. It allows programmers to work with uncertainties and make probabilistic inferences.

Defensive programming is an approach to coding that ensures the code works under unforeseen circumstances. It aims to improve comprehension, predictability, and simplify maintenance. A defensively programmed method or class should have a clear and single purpose, a clear name with a clear intent matching the implementation, no unexpected side effects, short and concise code, testability, input validation, exception handling, a clear contract, sensible return values, no leaky abstractions, and comments to explain why things are done.

2) Open-closed principle: It should be possible to extend the functionality of a class (open), but not modify the class itself (closed).
3) Liskov substitution principle: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub-types without altering the correctness of the program.
4) Interface segregation principle: Split large interfaces into smaller and more specific ones, so that implementations only need to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

Interface segregation principle Split interfaces which are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that any implementation only will have to know about the methods that are of interest to them. Dependency Inversion Principle 1) Defensive programming The main purposes of defensive programming is to ensure that a piece of code works under unforeseen circumstances, to improve comprehension and predictability and to simplify maintenance. To program defensively, make sure each method (as well as class, variable and property where applicable): * Has a clear and single purpose * Has a clear name with a clear intent (that matches the implementation) * Does not have any unexpected side effects (i.e. it should not perform operations that is not to be expected) * Is short and concise * Is testable * Validates input * Handles exceptions * Has a clear contract * Has sensible return values * Does not have any leaky abstractions (internal details and limitations should be kept internal) * Use comments (with moderation) to explain why things are done (if you feel that you need to explain how something is done you should consider refactor the code instead) Also, make sure that your code follows best practice guidelines, methodologies and programming techniques so that other programmers (and yourself after some time) easily can grasp how the code works. 2) Unit testing Unit testing will reduce the number of bugs in production, make it less risky to change and refactor code and will prevent any regressions to reoccur. When done right, it can also make you write better code. Sure, it can be tedious work and it takes time to write but it is totally worth it. Read more about unit testing here: http://www.codeaddiction.net/articles/23/introduction-to-unit-testing-in-c 3) Adhere to the SOLID-principles S.O.L.I.D. is an acronym that states five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design. These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to refactor code and avoid code smell. S.O.L.I.D stands for (very simply put): Single-responsibility principle Every class should have a single responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. If a class has more than one ""reason to change"" (i.e. it tries to solve many problems) it should be split up. Open-closed principle It should be possible to extend the functionality of a class (open), but not to modify the class itself (closed). Here's an example of what the ""closed-part"" means: A method (MakeJuice) is taking objects as parameters that implements a specific interface (IFruit). When done right, we should be able to create new types of fruit and run it though MakeJuice without needing to change the implementation of the method, this means that it is ""closed"". Liskov substitution principle Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub-types without altering the correctness of that program. Interface segregation principle Split interfaces which are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that any implementation only will have to know about the methods that are of interest to them. Dependency Inversion Principle If a class X depends on a another class Y, make sure that the dependency is done through an interface.

"The open-closed principle states that it should be possible to extend the functionality of a class (open) without modifying the class itself (closed). This principle is exemplified by methods that can take objects implementing a specific interface and can handle new types of objects without requiring changes to the method's implementation.

The Liskov substitution principle states that objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program. This principle enables polymorphism and inheritance in object-oriented programming.

The interface segregation principle suggests splitting large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones. This allows implementations to only need knowledge of the methods that are relevant to them, resulting in more focused and maintainable code.

The dependency inversion principle refers to the practice of depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. By using interfaces, classes can be designed to depend on higher-level abstractions, which provides flexibility and allows for easier replacement of dependencies.

Siamesing refers to combining two devices together into a closely coupled pair, often done to save space between them. An example of siamesing is combining cylinder ports or cooling jackets.

Count-distinct is the process of counting the number of unique items in a stream that may contain duplicate items. It is equivalent to determining the cardinality of a multiset.

The idea of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is the opposite of traditional hashing. Instead of aiming for uniform distribution across hash values, LSH is designed to group similar items together with high probability, based on the idea of defining hash functions that preserve similarity in the data.

Load balancing can be metaphorically understood using the example of ""balls and bins"". Imagine having m balls and n bins, and you want to distribute the balls into the bins. An adversary keeps throwing balls at you, and you have to put them into the bins before the next ball comes. It becomes challenging to remember or count how many balls are in each bin. Load balancing works similarly, where the goal is to evenly distribute workload across multiple resources or servers.

The structural difference between Proxy and State is that Proxy has only one implementation, while State has multiple implementations. Proxy is a design pattern used to provide controlled access to the target object, while State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes","[Front: Open-closed principle Back: Possible to extend the functionality of a class (open), but not to modify the class itself (closed). eg: A method (MakeJuice) is taking objects as parameters that implements a specific interface (IFruit).

Chapter 1: Introduction to Pipelines in Computer Science

A pipeline in computer science refers to a design pattern that allows for efficient and parallel execution of tasks by breaking them down into smaller, well-defined steps. In a properly designed pipeline, inputs are clearly defined and expected, while outputs adhere to specific requirements. However, in case of failure, the pipeline should provide clear indications of where and why it halted.

One of the key principles in pipeline design is the understanding that functionality is an asset, while code can often be seen as a liability. This means that while a pipeline's functionality is valuable, excessive and complex code can hinder its effectiveness.

Understanding the concepts and principles behind pipelines is crucial for computer scientists and developers, as it can greatly improve the efficiency and scalability of software systems. In the following chapters, we will explore different types of pipelines and their applications in various domains.","[Front: What is a pipeline?

Chapter 2: Problem Decomposition and Programming Concepts

When faced with solving complex problems, an effective approach is to break them down into smaller, more manageable parts. This process, known as problem decomposition, allows for better structure and organization of the overall solution.

One approach to problem decomposition is the ""wishful thinking"" method, which involves naming and specifying hypothetical routines that could solve unsolved parts of the problem. These routines are then used as placeholders during the initial implementation, with the intention of revisiting them later to complete the implementation.

Another concept important to programming is understanding the effort and complexity involved in suggested features or design changes. The phrase ""Small Matter of Programming (SMOP)"" is often used to ironically indicate that proposed changes may require significant effort and can be underestimated in terms of their cost.

Additionally, the functions reduce() and filter() are commonly used in programming to manipulate and process sequences of data. The reduce() function combines elements of a sequence using a supplied function to produce a single value. On the other hand, the filter() function extracts elements from a sequence based on a specified condition.

By understanding these problem decomposition techniques and programming concepts, computer scientists can approach complex problems with a structured mindset and efficiently design solutions that meet requirements.","[Front: “wishful thinking” approach to problem decomposition Back: When faced with an unsolved part of the problem: 1. name and specify a routine that would solve it 2. use that hypothetical routine, 3. come back later to implement it eg: outlining before writing a paper],

Chapter 3: Classic Quotes and Concepts in Computer Science

Dijkstra, a renowned computer scientist, made significant contributions to the field and shared insightful thoughts on various aspects of computer science. These quotes and concepts provide valuable insights into the principles and philosophies behind computer science.

Dijkstra emphasized the importance of thorough testing, stating that testing reveals the presence of bugs rather than their absence. This quote underscores the importance of rigorous testing and quality assurance processes in software development.

He also compared computer science to astronomy, stating that just as astronomy is not solely about telescopes, computer science is not solely about computers. This highlights the fact that computer science encompasses a broad range of principles, theories, and problem-solving techniques.

Dijkstra expressed skepticism towards artificial intelligence, equating the question of whether computers can think to asking if submarines can swim. This serves as a reminder to critically examine the boundaries and limitations of computer-based systems.

Another fundamental concept highlighted by Dijkstra is the importance of simplicity in achieving reliability. Simplicity serves as a prerequisite for robust and dependable systems.

In addition to these concepts, set 3 includes definitions for specific types of memory (non-volatile random-access memory and dynamic random-access memory) and introduces the concept of searching as a problem-solving technique.

Chapter 4: Functions and Abstraction in Programming

Functions play a vital role in programming and software development. They serve as building blocks for organizing and encapsulating logic, enabling a modular and reusable approach to coding.

Putting all logic into functions is a fundamental principle that guides the development process. This approach ensures that every piece of functionality in a program is encapsulated within a specific function, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain. Additionally, this principle promotes the ""Input => Output"" paradigm, where functions take inputs and produce outputs, simplifying the overall program structure.

Abstraction is another critical concept in programming. Abstract data types (ADTs) provide a way to describe the problem domain, allowing developers to focus on the high-level representation of data and operations, rather than the specific implementation details. This abstraction enhances code readability, reusability, and maintainability.

By understanding the significance of functions and abstraction in programming, developers can create well-structured and maintainable code that adheres to best practices and promotes efficient software development",[Front: Put all logic into ______. Back: functions Everything becomes Input => Output]
"Programs are made of nouns and verbs. A noun represents data, such as a Message, DataFrame, List, Tree, etc. A verb represents an action, such as toString, toInt, readFile, etc. 

To remove elements from a list if a certain condition is met, we can use the filter function. For example, if we have a list of words [""team"", ""coffee"", ""function""], we can use the filter function to remove words that contain the substring ""fun"" as follows: List(""team"", ""coffee"", ""function"").filter { x => x.contains(""fun"") }. The resulting list will be [""function""].

The foldLeft function allows us to accumulate a value from a list in a right-to-left order. It requires an initial value, a function that takes two arguments (accumulated value and current element) and returns a new value, and a list. For example, if we want to compute the sum of a list of numbers, we can use foldLeft as follows: List(1, 2, 3, 4).foldLeft(0) { (acc, num) => acc + num }. The result will be 10.

When something doesn't behave as expected at runtime, we have two options: 1) terminate the program (die), or 2) manually add error checking and handle the problem gracefully.

CPUs are designed for executing sequential and complex tasks, while GPUs are designed for executing parallel and low-level tasks.

Some algorithms are inherently parallel and can be accelerated using GPU. For example, matrix operations and algorithms that involve a high number of floating-point operations per second (FLOPS).

CPU and GPU architectures differ in terms of their design and purpose. CPUs are designed for executing sequential and complex tasks, while GPUs are designed for executing parallel and low-level tasks.

The Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) is the problem of finding a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements given an ordering of preferences for each element. The Gale-Shapley algorithm is often used to solve this problem.

"A bus is a path for electrical signals, allowing for communication between different components of a computer system.

All computer programs perform three main actions: 1) fetching the next instruction from memory, 2) decoding the instruction to determine the next step, and 3) executing the instruction by issuing commands to the ALU, memory, and I/O controllers.

To work with real numbers on a computer, we typically approximate them to 16 digits using finite bit strings.

The best story analogy for understanding quicksort is imagining you walk into a gymnasium with 200 children and want to find the 98th shortest child using a technique called QUICKSELECT.

When you open your eyes, you are pointing directly at one of the children, Peter Pivot. You say, “Quickly! Everybody shorter than Peter, come stand over here. And everybody taller than Peter, go stand over there. If you're the same height as Peter, you can go into either group.” The children shuffle around, and soon they are standing in the two groups.

"Kolmogorov Complexity: 
Kolmogorov complexity is a measure of the complexity of an object, defined as the length of the shortest possible description of the object. According to the concept of Kolmogorov complexity, an object's complexity is determined by the time it takes to describe it. For example, consider two strings: x = ""2398383029221"" and y = ""0000000000000"". Although both strings have the same length, the string x is considered more complex because it cannot be described concisely using a simple pattern, unlike the string y which can be described as ""13 zeros"".

"Nanosecond (ns):
A nanosecond is a unit of time equal to one billionth (10^-9) of a second. It is commonly used to measure the read or write access time to random access memory (RAM).

Microsecond (us):
A microsecond is a unit of time equal to one millionth (10^-6) of a second. It is used for more precise timing measurements compared to milliseconds or seconds.

Coroutines and Generators:
In programming, generators can be viewed as a special case of coroutines. Generators are subroutines that can be paused and resumed, allowing them to produce a sequence of values over time. Coroutines, on the other hand, are a more generalized form of subroutines. They can be entered, exited, and resumed at various points, not just at the beginning or end. Coroutines are often used to build pipelines, where multiple coroutines are linked together to process data step by step without the need for a central coordinating function.

Von Neumann Architecture:
The von Neumann architecture is a theoretical computer architecture framework, which forms the basis for most modern computer systems. It is characterized by the close coupling of semantics to state transitions, the division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements, and the lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs. While the von Neumann architecture has been successful in building general-purpose computers, it is not without its downsides.

Binary Neurons and NAND Gates:
Binary neurons, also known as NAND gates, serve as fundamental building blocks in digital logic circuits. They are capable of performing logical operations such as negation, conjunction, and disjunction. The ability to construct complex circuits using binary neurons allows for the implementation of various computational functionalities in computer systems.

Probabilistic Programming Steps:
Probabilistic programming is a programming paradigm that enables the formulation and analysis of models involving uncertainty. The steps involved in probabilistic programming are as follows:

1. Declare prior beliefs about data: Prior beliefs about what the data looks like are explicitly stated.
2. Feed in data: Actual data is provided as input to the program.
3. Obtain posterior distribution: A sampling algorithm is used to generate a posterior distribution for each of the parameters in the model. This posterior distribution provides a probabilistic description of the potential values for each parameter based on the prior beliefs and the observed data.","[Front: A nanosecond (ns or nsec) is Back: one billionth (10-9) of a second A common measurement of read or write access time to random access memory (RAM).],

"CPUs vs. GPUs:
CPUs (Central Processing Units) and GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are two types of processor units with distinct characteristics.

CPUs are designed to handle general-purpose computing tasks. They are optimized for following complex sets of instructions and are capable of rapidly switching between tasks. CPUs are responsible for executing a wide variety of software, including operating systems and applications.

On the other hand, GPUs were originally developed to handle graphics-related tasks such as rendering images, text, and geometry on computer screens. They are highly specialized processors designed to handle massive parallel calculations required for graphics processing. With advancements in GPU architecture, they are now being used for non-graphics tasks like machine learning, scientific simulations, and data processing.

When it comes to performance, GPUs excel at tasks that can be parallelized, such as image rendering or simulating physical phenomena. CPUs, on the other hand, are better suited for tasks that require complex decision-making and managing multiple tasks simultaneously.

Names and Intent:
In programming, it is crucial to choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, etc. Names should effectively communicate the coder's intent, enabling other readers of the code to easily understand its purpose and functionality. By choosing appropriate names, the code becomes more readable and maintainable, reducing the need for readers to spend effort deciphering the meaning of obscure or ambiguous names.","[Front: What are the difference between CPUs and GPUs?

"Refactoring Variable Names:
Refactoring entails making code improvements without changing its functionality. One aspect of refactoring is ensuring that variable names accurately convey the purpose of the variable. Here are some examples:

1. Refactor this bad variable name: hostList -> Refactored name: hosts
2. Refactor this bad variable name: hostSet -> Refactored name: validHosts
3. Refactor this bad variable name: hostInputStream -> Refactored name: rawHostData

6. Refactor this bad variable name: valueString -> Refactored name: firstName
7. Refactor this bad variable name: intPort -> Refactored name: portNumber

Teutonic Naming:
Teutonic naming is a principle in software development that encourages developers to use names that are as specific as possible without being incorrect. By adopting this practice, code becomes more self-explanatory and understandable to others. An example of Teutonic naming is using a name like ""tcpPortNumber"" to indicate a specific type of port number in a TCP-based network communication context","[Front: Refactor this bad variable name: hostList Back: hosts],

"- A B+ tree is an n-ary tree with a variable, but often a large number of children per node. It is primarily used for efficient data retrieval in block-oriented storage contexts, such as filesystems, due to its high fanout.

- Broadworld computing refers to the concept of creating algorithms that operate in parallel at the bit-level. It involves dealing with n-bit words, where n is a parameter that is not extremely small. Examples of broadworld computing include operations on bitmaps, designing data structures, and branchless computation.

- Bit masks are used when there is a need to access specific bits in a byte of data. They are useful for iteration purposes, such as when transmitting a byte of data serially through a single pin. In this case, the state of the pin needs to change from high to low for each bit in the byte being transmitted.

- Bit masks work by defining which bits to keep and which bits to clear. Bitwise ANDing allows the extraction of a subset of bits, bitwise ORing sets a subset of bits, and bitwise XORing toggles a subset of bits. For example, applying a mask of 00001111b (15 in decimal) to a value of 01010101b (85 in decimal) results in 00000101b (5 in decimal).

"**Metaphor for computer caches:** Computer caches can be metaphorically compared to a desk with paperwork. The desk represents the L1 data cache, where files (cache lines) that you are currently working on or recently pulled are stored. The files are treated as units, just like you grab whole files at a time even if you only need a specific page from it. The filing cabinet symbolizes the L2 cache, containing files that you've handled recently but are not using at the moment. When you're done with the files on your desk, most of them will go back into the filing cabinet. Accessing the files in the cabinet is relatively quick but not immediate. 

**Taco Bell Programming:** Taco Bell Programming refers to building a project using standard Unix tools instead of relying heavily on the latest, trendy tools or libraries. This approach focuses on the tried-and-true tools to achieve the desired results efficiently.

**Von Neumann bottleneck:** The Von Neumann bottleneck refers to the limitation caused by the shared bus between program memory and data memory in a computer. The bottleneck arises because the single bus can only access one class of memory at a time, resulting in reduced throughput compared to the processing speed of the CPU. This limitation becomes significant when the CPU needs to perform minimal processing on large amounts of data.

**Quine:** A Quine is a non-empty computer program that takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. In other words, Quines are self-replicating programs.

**Gale–Shapley algorithm:** The Gale–Shapley algorithm is an algorithm used for stable matching. It works by following a series of rounds. In the first round, each unengaged man proposes to the woman he prefers the most. Each woman then replies with ""maybe"" to her most preferred suitor and ""no"" to all other suitors. This process continues with subsequent rounds. In each round, unengaged men propose to the most preferred woman they have not yet proposed to, while women reply ""maybe"" if they are not currently engaged or if they prefer this new suitor over their current provisional partner. The algorithm continues until everyone is engaged.

**A computer should never:** According to Eric Raymond, a computer should never ask the user for any information that it can autodetect, copy, or deduce. The idea is to reduce unnecessary interaction and automate tasks as much as possible.

**Skyline operator:** The Skyline operator is used in queries to filter results from a database. It keeps only those objects that are not worse than any other object based on specified criteria.

"**Zero-copy:** Zero-copy refers to computer operations in which the CPU does not perform the task of copying data from one memory area to another. This technique enhances performance by allowing the CPU to move on to other tasks while data copies proceed in parallel in another part of the machine. For example, when reading a file and sending it over a network, the traditional method requires two data copies and two context switches per read/write cycle. Zero-copy reduces the context switches to two and eliminates all CPU data copies.

**Predicate:** A predicate is a function that returns true for an outcome that is in the event being considered. Essentially, it is a test or condition used to determine whether a specific outcome is true or false.

**Endianness:** Endianness refers to the order of bytes that compose a digital word in computer memory. It determines whether the most significant byte (Big Endian) or the least significant byte (Little Endian) is stored in the smallest address.

**Memory:** All you need to know about memory is that it's one large array. This statement highlights the concept of memory being organized as a contiguous collection of addressable locations, forming a single large array.

**Big Endian:** In Big Endian representation, a 32-bit quantity is written as 90AB12CD, where the most significant byte is stored in the smallest address position. This means that the bytes are ordered from left to right in memory.

**Little Endian:** In Little Endian representation, a 32-bit quantity is written as 90AB12CD, where the least significant byte is stored in the smallest address position. This means that the bytes are ordered from right to left in memory.

However, its impact has now shifted to mean that the cost of computing is halved every two years. This change in interpretation indicates the progression towards ubiquitous computing.

**Mathematical induction:** Mathematical induction is a proof technique that involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. In the base case, the algorithm is demonstrated to work for a specific starting point. In the inductive step, it is shown that the algorithm works for a larger, but directly related, case, building upon the previous step.

**Requirements for a hash function:** A hash function should meet two general requirements. Firstly, it should be consistent, meaning that the same string always produces the same hash value. Secondly, it should map different input strings to different hash values, ensuring that collisions (multiple inputs producing the same hash) are minimized.

**Functor:** A functor is a type of mapping between categories in mathematics. In terms of programming, a functor can be seen as a closure or function used to remove characters from a string based on a given set of characters to remove.

**Doxxing:** Doxxing refers to the act of searching for and publishing private or identifying information about a particular individual on the internet. This is typically done with malicious intent, involving the exposure of personal details, such as phone numbers or addresses.

Ideally, abstractions should hide away implementation details. As an example, iterating over a large two-dimensional array may have significantly different performance depending on the order in which elements are stored in memory. This exposes the details of memory organization to the user, impacting performance.

**Plain English definition of abstraction:** Abstraction can be understood as selective ignorance, where programmers focus only on the relevant ideas for the task at hand and disregard everything else. This concentrated approach allows developers to tackle complex problems more effectively. Abstraction is considered the most important concept in modern programming.

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption:** Fully Homomorphic Encryption refers to a type of encryption that enables computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without decrypting it beforehand.

Back: Hexadecimal is often used as a bridge between binary/bytes and decimal. It provides a more compact representation of binary values and is easier to work with compared to writing out long binary strings. Hexadecimal is commonly used in low-level programming and debugging situations.

Flashcard 2:
Front: How is a CPU optimized for processing?
Back: CPUs are designed to be latency optimized for fast serial processing. This means that they are optimized to execute instructions quickly one after another in a sequential manner, allowing for efficient processing of tasks that require a single, serial stream of instructions.

Flashcard 3:
Front: How are GPUs optimized for processing?
Back: GPUs are optimized for throughput, which enables fast parallel processing. GPUs have a large number of parallel processing units, called cores, that can execute multiple instructions simultaneously. This makes them well-suited for tasks that require performing many calculations in parallel, such as graphics rendering and scientific computations.

Flashcard 4:

Back: Data modeling 101 involves four main components:
1. Entity: A discrete thing in the real world that we want to represent and store data about.
2. Attribute: Information about an entity, such as its characteristics or properties.
3. Fact: A level of attribute that provides specific details or values.
4. Events: Things that happen in the real world and can be recorded as data, such as transactions or occurrences.

Flashcard 5:
Front: What is pseudocode?
Back: Pseudocode is like blueprints without any of the details. It is an informal notation that helps outline the structure and logic of a program, but it does not provide specific implementation details. Pseudocode is often used during the initial stages of program design to outline the steps and operations required to solve a problem.

Flashcard 6:
Front: What is an opcode?
Back: An opcode, short for ""operation code,"" is the portion of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed by the CPU. Opcodes also specify the data (operands) involved in the operation.

Flashcard 7:
Front: What is semantic versioning?
Back: Semantic versioning, also known as SemVer, is a version numbering scheme commonly used in software development. It consists of three parts: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. The MAJOR version increments when incompatible API changes are made, the MINOR version increments when new functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner, and the PATCH version increments when backwards-compatible bug fixes are implemented.

Flashcard 8:
Front: What is data structure alignment?
Back: Data structure alignment refers to the way data is arranged and accessed in computer memory. It involves two main issues: data alignment and data structure padding. When a computer reads from or writes to a memory address, it usually does so in word-sized chunks (e.g., 4-byte chunks on a 32-bit system). Data structure alignment ensures that data is stored in memory on aligned addresses to optimize memory access and ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.

"Title: Data Structures and Algorithms

Flashcard 1:
Front: What is each position of the hash table often called?
Back: Each position of the hash table is often called a ""slot."" A slot holds an item or element and corresponds to a specific location within the hash table's underlying data structure.

Flashcard 2:
Front: What is a hash function?
Back: A hash function is responsible for mapping an item to the correct slot in a hash table. It takes an item as an input and produces an output, which is the index of the slot where that item belongs. In most implementations, the hash function calculates the modulo of the hash value with the length of the hash table to determine the slot.

Flashcard 3:
Front: What is the load factor of a hash table?
Back: The load factor (λ) of a hash table is defined as the ratio of the number of items stored in the hash table to the total number of slots in the hash table. It indicates how full the hash table is and affects its performance. For example, a load factor of λ = 6/11 means that the hash table is approximately 54.5% full.

Flashcard 4:
Front: What is another word for collision?
Back: Another word for collision in the context of hash tables is a ""clash"". A collision occurs when two or more items are mapped to the same slot in the hash table, leading to a clash or conflict. Resolving collisions is a key consideration in designing efficient hash table implementations.","[Front: Each position of the hash table is often called _____ Back: a slot],

"Title: Programming Concepts and Techniques

Flashcard 1:
Front: What is a perfect hash function?
Back: A perfect hash function is a hash function that maps each item in a collection to a unique slot in a hash table. It ensures no collisions occur, as each item is uniquely assigned to a specific slot in the hash table.

Flashcard 2:
Front: What is the folding method for constructing hash functions?
Back: The folding method is a technique for constructing hash functions. It involves dividing the item into equal-size pieces (the last piece may not be of equal size), adding these pieces together, and then calculating the modulo of the resulting sum with the number of slots in the hash table. This determines the index of the slot where the item should be stored.

Flashcard 3:
Front: What is the mid-square method for hashing?
Back: The mid-square method is a technique for constructing hash functions. It involves squaring the item, taking the middle digits of the squared value, and then calculating the modulo of the extracted digits with the number of slots in the hash table. This determines the index of the slot where the item should be stored.

Flashcard 4:
Front: What is open addressing?
Back: Open addressing is a method used to resolve hash collisions in hash tables. When a collision occurs, open addressing involves sequentially searching through the slots of the hash table, starting from the original hash value position, until an empty slot is found. The item causing the collision is then stored in the first available slot.

Flashcard 5:
Front: What is linear probing?
Back: Linear probing is a specific technique used in open addressing to resolve hash collisions. It involves systematically visiting each slot, one at a time, starting from the original hash value position until an empty slot is found. Linear probing is one example of open addressing, where the search for an empty slot proceeds linearly through the slots.

Flashcard 6:
Front: True or False: .1 + .2 ≠ .3.
Back: True. Computers can only store integers effectively, and thus, floating-point math is inherently prone to rounding errors. This specific example demonstrates one such case where the representation of decimal fractions in floating-point format may not match the exact decimal value. It is essential to understand the limitations of floating-point math when working with decimal values in computer programs.

Flashcard 7:
Front: If L1 Cache is like a sandwich in front of you, what is L2 Cache? What is RAM? What is a Hard Drive?
Back: In the analogy of a sandwich, L2 Cache can be compared to walking to the kitchen and making a sandwich. L2 Cache is a type of memory that provides higher capacity and slower access times compared to L1 Cache, but still faster than other forms of memory like RAM or the hard drive.

RAM, on the other hand, can be likened to driving to the store, purchasing sandwich fixings, driving home, and making a sandwich. It stands for Random Access Memory and serves as temporary storage for data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly during program execution.

Finally, the analogy compares the hard drive to driving to the store, purchasing seeds, growing lettuce, wheat, etc., and then making a sandwich. The hard drive is a non-volatile storage device that stores data over long periods, even when the power is turned off. It provides large storage capacity but slower access times compared to RAM or Cache.","[Front: perfect hash function Back: Given a collection of items, a hash function that maps each item into a unique slot],

Grover's algorithm typically requires O(sqrt(N)) evaluations of the function, where N is the size of the function's domain. It offers a significant speedup compared to classical search algorithms.

Chapter 5: SAT (Satisfiability Problem)

The SAT problem involves determining whether a given Boolean formula can be satisfied. It asks whether there exists an assignment of truth values to the variables that make the formula evaluate to true. SAT is an important problem in computer science and has applications in areas such as artificial intelligence and circuit design. It can be solved using various methods, including algorithms that employ logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction techniques.

Chapter 6: Pseudo-Random Numbers

Pseudo-random numbers are sequences of numbers generated by deterministic algorithms. They are used in various computational tasks as they exhibit statistical properties that resemble those of truly random numbers. The use of pseudo-random numbers allows for the ability to restart a process with the same seed. Additionally, truly random numbers may not be generated fast enough or may not be suitable for certain applications.

Chapter 7: Logic Programming

Logic programming is a programming paradigm where computation is carried out based on a knowledge repository of facts and rules. Languages such as LISP and Prolog are examples of logic programming languages. In logic programming, programs are expressed as sets of logical predicates and rules that define relationships between them. It enables declarative programming and is particularly useful for solving problems involving symbolic reasoning and constraint satisfaction.

"Big O cost of looking at most/all pairs: 
- Θ(n²) 

Explanation: The Big O notation indicates the upper bound of the worst-case scenario for an algorithm's time complexity. When looking at most or all pairs of elements, the typical complexity is Θ(n²), meaning the number of operations grows quadratically with the input size n.

Big O of Selection Sort and Insertion Sort: 
- Θ(n²) 

Explanation: Both Selection Sort and Insertion Sort have an average and worst-case time complexity of Θ(n²). This quadratic complexity arises due to the need for multiple comparisons and swapping operations, resulting in a number of iterations proportional to the square of n.

Big O of Enumerating all Subsets:

- Differs for negative numbers 
- Negative numbers represented using two's complement

Explanation: Two's complement binary representation is similar to the classical binary representation for positive integers. However, it differs when representing negative numbers. In two's complement, negative numbers are represented by performing the two's complement operation on their absolute value. The representation allows signed numbers to be added, subtracted, and manipulated using the same mechanisms as positive numbers.

For example, in two's complement, 0 is represented as ""0,"" 1 as ""1,"" 2 as ""10,"" 3 as ""11,"" 4 as ""100,"" 5 as ""101,"" and so on. The value of a negative number is calculated by inverting the bits of its absolute value and adding one","[Front: What is the Big O cost of looking at most / all pairs? Back: Θ(n²)],

"**What is two's complement binary for negative integers?**
Negative numbers are written with a leading one instead of a leading zero. The binary representation ranges from ""00000000"" to ""01111111"" for the whole numbers from 0 to 127. The bit pattern ""1xxxxxxx"" is reserved for writing negative numbers. To represent a negative number, -x, the bit pattern for (x-1) is used, with all of the bits complemented (switched from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1). For example, -1 is represented as complement(1 - 1) = complement(0) = ""11111111"", and -10 is represented as complement(10 - 1) = complement(9) = complement(""00001001"") = ""11110110"". Negative numbers can go all the way down to -128, represented as ""10000000"".

**x << y**
The ""x << y"" operation shifts the bits of x to the left by y places. This is equivalent to multiplying x by 2^y. For example, 3 << 4 is equal to 3 * (2^4).

Topological sorting is the most important operation on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It arranges the vertices on a line in such a way that all directed edges go from left to right.

Each DAG has at least one possible topological sort.

Topological sorting finds practical use in providing an ordering to process each vertex before any of its successors. It can be employed in scenarios where precedence constraints are represented by edges, indicating that one job must be completed before another. Any valid topological sort defines a valid schedule.

"The flashcards in this set pertain to RESTful API operations and concepts in cryptography.

RESTful POST, similar to the ""Create"" operation in CRUD, is used to send data, typically to create a new resource on the server.

RESTful GET, akin to the ""Retrieve"" operation in CRUD, is employed to fetch data from the server, often to retrieve a specific resource or a collection of resources.

RESTful PUT/PATCH, equivalent to the ""Update"" operation in CRUD, facilitates modifying or updating existing resources on the server.

RESTful DELETE, similar to the ""Delete"" operation in CRUD, allows for the removal of a specific resource from the server.

Nonce refers to an arbitrary number that is designed to be used only once. It finds application in cryptography, where it adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that a value cannot be used again.

"Algorithmic Approaches for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):
- Nearest Neighbor Algorithm: This approach involves starting at a city and repeatedly choosing the closest neighboring city until all cities have been visited. This may result in a suboptimal solution but is computationally efficient.
- Greedy Algorithm: Here, the shortest distance between any two cities is found and added to the tour. This process is repeated until all cities have been visited. Again, this method may not always yield the optimal solution but is faster than other approaches.

Branch and Cut Technique:
- In this technique, a search for an optimal solution can be terminated early if a partially constructed solution is obviously not optimal. One example of such a scenario would be if a partial segment's total distance is greater than the total distance of another existing solution. The partial segment can then be discarded as it cannot be part of the optimal solution.

Bit Shifting Operations:
- Left Shifting (<<): The expression ""x << y"" is equivalent to multiplying x by 2 raised to the power of y. For example, 3 << 4 is equal to 3 multiplied by 2 raised to the power of 4, resulting in 48.
- Right Shifting (>>): The expression ""x >> y"" is equivalent to integer division of x by 2 raised to the power of y. For instance, 48 >> 4 is equal to 48 divided by 2 raised to the power of 4, resulting in 3.

XOR Operation:
- XOR (⊕) is a logical operation that returns true (1) if the two bits being XORed are different, and false (0) otherwise. When XORing zero with any bit, the result is the bit itself.","[Front: What are two approximate algorithms for TSP? Back: 1.

"XOR Operation for Same Bits:
- When XORing two bits that are the same, the result is 0. For example, a⊕a evaluates to 0.","[Front: If we take XOR of the two same bits, it will return Back: 0 a⊕a=0]"
"XOR Operation Properties:
- The XOR operation (⊕) is associative, meaning the grouping of operands do not affect the result. Thus, a⊕b⊕a is the same as (a⊕a)⊕b, which simplifies to 0⊕b, and finally b.

Time and Space Complexity of reduce() Function:
- The reduce() function from the functools library is used in combination with the lambda expression to perform a bitwise XOR operation on a list of numbers. The time complexity is linear, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list since we only iterate through the numbers. The space complexity is constant, O(1), as we are not using any additional memory that scales with the input size.

Time to Live (TTL):
- Time to Live (TTL) is a mechanism that limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or network. It is typically implemented as a counter attached to the data and reflects the number of hops that the data can traverse before being discarded.

Big O and Space Complexity of BFS and DFS:
- The time complexity of both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms is linear, O(|V|+|E|), where |V| represents the number of vertices or nodes, and |E| represents the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity, however, differs for BFS and DFS. BFS has a space complexity of O(|V|), as it needs to maintain a hash table to track the visited nodes and a queue to store the nodes to be explored. DFS has a space complexity of O(|V|) as well, but it also utilizes the call stack for recursion.","[Front: a⊕b⊕a= Back: (a⊕a)⊕b = 0⊕b = b because: a⊕0=a a⊕a=0],

"Cycle Detection Algorithm:
- Depth-First Search (DFS) can be used to detect cycles in a graph. A cycle exists in a graph if a back edge is present. A back edge refers to an edge that connects a node to itself (self-loop) or one of its ancestors in the DFS tree.

Distance Computation Algorithm:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) is commonly employed to compute distances in a graph. It explores the graph layer by layer, ensuring that the shortest path from the source node to any other node is discovered first.

API Design Steps:
1. Identify Nouns and Verbs: In the API design process, the first step is to analyze the system specifications and extract the relevant nouns and verbs.
2. Extract URLs and Methods: Based on the identified nouns and verbs, relevant URLs and the appropriate HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, etc.) are determined.

Difference between GET and POST:
- GET is used to retrieve data from the server, whereas POST is used to provide data to the server. GET requests are typically read-only and should not have any side effects, while POST requests can modify server data.

HTTP Status Codes:
- 1xx: Informational responses.
- 2xx: Success responses.
- 3xx: Redirection responses.

The Iterator Pattern helps abstract away the details of collection traversal, making code more modular and reusable",[Front: Iterator Pattern Back: A clean interface for element-by-element access to a collection Including mapping and accumulating]
"**Iterator pattern:**
- The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- The three main operations of the Iterator pattern are:
  1. Access current element: The iterator allows accessing the current element in the aggregate object.
  2. Advance to next element: The iterator provides a method to move to the next element in the sequence.
  3. Check for completion: The iterator provides a mechanism to check if all elements have been traversed.

**Abstract Factory:**
- Abstract Factory is an object-oriented design pattern that allows creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes at compile-time.
- It enables the creation of objects belonging to different styles or variants while guaranteeing compatibility within each family.
- For example, an abstract factory for creating furniture sets can define a general chair interface, and concrete factories can specify the style of the chair later, such as Victorian or Modern.

**Parity function:**
- The Parity function is a Boolean function that determines whether the input vector has an odd number of ones.
- It returns 1 if and only if the input vector has an odd number of ones; otherwise, it returns 0.
- For example, the input vector 010101 has an odd number of ones, so the parity function applied to it returns 1 (parity bit).","[Front: What are 3 three operations of the Interator pattern? Back: 1. Access current element 2. Advance to next element 3. Check for completion],

"**Two's complement:**
- Two's complement is a mathematical representation for signed integers in computing systems.
- In two's complement, -1 is represented as the binary value ""11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111"".
- The most significant bit (MSB) is interpreted as the sign bit, where 0 represents a positive number and 1 represents a negative number.

**Negating a two's complement binary number:**
- To negate a two's complement binary number, perform the following steps:
  1. Switch every 0 with a 1.
  2. Switch every 1 with a 0.
  3. Add 1 to the resulting binary number.
- This operation effectively changes the sign of the number in two's complement representation.

**kLOC and MLOC:**
- kLOC stands for ""thousands of lines of code,"" and MLOC stands for ""millions of lines of code.""
- These terms are used to measure the size or complexity of a software system in terms of the number of lines of code it contains.
- For example, a software project with 10,000 lines of code can be referred to as 10 kLOC.

**Async vs. Threads:**
- Asynchronous programming is often preferred over threads for several reasons:
  1. Handles more connections: Asynchronous code can handle a higher number of simultaneous connections compared to traditional multi-threading approaches.
  2. Concurrency is visible: Asynchronous code explicitly shows where concurrent operations occur, improving readability and maintainability.
  3. Data structures are not racy: Asynchronous programming mitigates the risk of data races by design, reducing potential bugs related to simultaneous data access.","[Front: In two's complement, what is -1? Back: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111],

A cache is a small, fast memory that buffers recently executed instructions, mostly for results that are likely to be reused soon. By storing frequently used data in the cache, the system can reduce the latency and improve the overall performance of memory access.

The best way to upgrade a legacy software system is through the Strangler pattern. This approach involves slowly replacing features one by one, offering several advantages over a complete rewrite. It is less politically challenging, quicker to show value, and mitigates the risk of the lava flow anti-pattern where the upgrade process could get stopped and restarted in a different way.

It is important to note that all databases have schemas, even those that claim not to. The schema defines the structure and organization of the data stored in the database, and it is necessary for proper data management and access.

A Horn clause is a logical clause that contains at most one positive example. It is a fundamental concept in logic programming, commonly expressed as a disjunction of literals. For example, the clause ""If someone is not human, then they are mortal"" can be represented as ¬human(X) ∨ mortal(X).

Acceptance testing is a type of testing that focuses on determining whether a system delivers business requirements and is ready for delivery. It aims to validate that the system meets the expectations and needs of the stakeholders.

Amdahl's Law states that the speedup achieved from a parallel computer is limited by the portion of the computation that must be executed sequentially. It highlights the importance of identifying and addressing the sequential bottlenecks in order to fully harness the potential of parallel computing.

Jevons paradox states that technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, but the rate of consumption of that resource rises due to increasing demand. This phenomenon challenges the assumption that advancements in technology will lead to reduced resource consumption. An example of Jevons paradox in action is the rise of cloud computing, where increased efficiency in resource utilization has resulted in higher overall consumption rather than savings.

In the context of performance analysis, there is a difference between Big O analysis and benchmarking. Big O analysis is a theoretical approach to analyzing the time complexity of algorithms. It provides an abstract idea of how the algorithm will perform as the input size grows. On the other hand, benchmarking is a practical measurement of performance for a specific implementation in code. It involves running the code with various inputs and measuring the actual execution time. Generally, benchmarking is considered the most accurate way to assess performance.

In many applications, the size of the data dominates the size of the container. This means that the data being stored or processed is usually much larger in size compared to the container or data structure used to hold it. For example, in a bucket of water, the weight is mostly determined by the water itself, rather than the bucket itself.

When dealing with non-binary states, business rules enforced by multiple booleans, and the expectation of new states in the future, it is recommended to use a state machine. A state machine is a mathematical model of computation that consists of a finite number of states and transitions between these states. It enables handling complex state-based logic and allows for flexibility in accommodating future state changes.

A state machine is characterized by its finite number of states, the transitions between those states (trigger, source, and destination), and the restriction that the machine can only be in a single state at any given time. It provides a structured approach to modeling and implementing complex logic that relies on state-driven behavior.

The data structure commonly used to represent a state machine is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). A DAG is a graph that is directed and acyclic, meaning it consists of nodes connected by directed edges without any cycles. In the context of a state machine, nodes represent the states, and edges represent the transitions between states.

URI stands for Unique Resource Identifier, which is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. URIs are commonly used in web programming to identify and locate resources such as web pages, images, or files. They provide a standardized way of referencing resources across different systems and protocols.

The main difference between analog and digital computing lies in the types of values and operations they deal with. Digital computing operates on integers, binary sequences, deterministic logic, and time that is idealized into discrete increments. In contrast, analog computing deals with real numbers, nondeterministic logic, and continuous functions, including time as it exists as a continuum in the real world. However, it is important to note that there is no precise distinction between analog and digital computing, as some systems may exhibit characteristics of both.

Regarding complexity, in analog computing, complexity primarily resides in network topology. The arrangement of components and connections within the analog system determines its functionality and performance. In contrast, in digital computing, complexity primarily resides in the code. The design and implementation of algorithms and data structures directly impact the functionality and efficiency of digital systems.","[Front: Complete this diagram: Back: ],

"Analog computing processes information as continuous functions of values, such as voltage and relative pulse frequency. It operates on the principles of analog signals and allows for continuous variation. On the other hand, digital computing processes information by performing logical operations on discrete strings of bits. It relies on digital signals and supports discrete values.

One key difference between analog and digital computing is their approach to handling errors. Analog computing tolerates errors and allows systems to continue operating despite errors. In contrast, digital computing is intolerant of errors or ambiguity and relies on error correction techniques at every step of the computation. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of digital systems.

Objects are specific entities that combine both data and procedures. They encapsulate data and the operations that can be performed on that data into a single unit. Objects form the basis of object-oriented programming, where programs are organized around objects and their interactions.

Functional programming is often characterized as value-oriented programming. It focuses on the consumption and production of values, treating computation as the arrangement of functions to compose and decompose values. Functional programming emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and declarative programming style.

Looping and recursion are two approaches to repetitive tasks in programming. Looping is a construct that allows executing a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met. It can iterate over a range or collection of values, executing the same set of instructions for each item. Recursion, on the other hand, involves calling a function within itself, solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. Recursion is a generalized form of looping that allows passing values and functions recursively.

A batch program is a type of program that has a well-defined beginning and end. It typically processes a set of input data as a batch, without requiring manual intervention or interaction. Batch programs are often used for automated data processing tasks, such as data conversion, report generation, or data manipulation.

Designing a data structure involves considering three major elements. These elements are the data organization, the algorithms that support basic operations such as putting, getting, and updating data, and the indexing strategy (optional) that facilitates efficient search and retrieval of data elements.

In software engineering, it is crucial to have named states that are accessible from the outside and should never be considered invisible. Named states provide modularity and a means to interact with the system. They allow for proper system design, debugging, and integration with other components.

There are three major kinds of parallel computing:

1. Multiprocessing: In this approach, two or more separate programs are run on separate processors. Each program performs its task independently, making multiprocessing suitable for parallel execution of unrelated tasks.

2. Parallel processing: In parallel processing, a single program is broken down into independent parts that can be executed simultaneously. The results of these independent parts are then merged to produce the final result. Parallel processing is ideal for tasks that can be decomposed into mutually independent subtasks.

3. Data parallelism: Data parallelism involves performing the same operation on a large number of values simultaneously. This approach is beneficial when a significant amount of data needs to be processed in the same way, such as in parallel computations involving large datasets","[Front: What is the difference between analog and digital computing wrt to information processing?

Question: What is the downside of abstraction?
Answer: The downside of abstraction is that it adds to the cognitive load of whoever works with the code. Abstraction separates the implementation from the specification, which can lead to confusion between what something actually does and what everybody believes it should do.

Flashcard 2:
Question: What is the significance of 32-bit architecture?
Answer: 32-bit architecture refers to the size of the memory bus on the CPU, which determines the number of addressable locations in memory. A 64-bit CPU can address 2^64 bits (18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bits / 2 zettabytes) of RAM.

Flashcard 3:
Question: What is the difference between registers and the arithmetic logic unit (ALU)?
Answer: Registers hold data, while the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) processes that data. Registers are small storage units located within the CPU, whereas the ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations on those register contents.

"Title: Software Development Principles and Techniques

Flashcard 1:
Question: When defining a data structure, what should be minimized?
Answer: When defining a data structure, it is essential to minimize computation and data movement. This ensures better performance and efficiency in software development.

Flashcard 2:
Question: What is the difference between functional notation and operator notation?
Answer: Equations written using functional notation, which utilizes operators like add(x, 0), are more difficult to reason about as compared to equations written with traditional operators like x + 0. Functional notation can add complexity to code readability.

Flashcard 3:
Question: Why is operator overloading useful?
Answer: Operator overloading improves code readability. It is easier to reason about expressions like n * (x + y) than it is to interpret expressions like mul(n, add(x, y)). Operator overloading enhances the clarity and understanding of code.

Flashcard 4:
Question: Why is zero-based indexing preferred?
Answer: Zero-based indexing allows programmers to access either the first n items (a[:n]) or the next n items starting at index i (a[i:i+n]). It provides a more intuitive and convenient way to handle array-like data structures.

Flashcard 5:
Question: What is the advantage of using 0-based indexing with half-open intervals?
Answer: 0-based indexing with half-open intervals allows for efficient string splitting or partitioning. For example, splitting a string into three parts at indices i and j results in three parts: a[:i], a[i:j], and a[j:].","[Front: When defining a data structure, ___________________.

"Title: Programming Paradigms and Software Development Techniques

Flashcard 1:
Question: What is meant by ""eager execution"" in programming?
Answer: ""Eager execution"" refers to the imperative programming paradigm where users write statements that change a program's state, as seen in languages like Python. In eager execution, statements are executed as soon as they are encountered.

Flashcard 2:
Question: Differentiate between nanoseconds, microseconds, and milliseconds.
Answer: Nanoseconds (1 ns) are the smallest unit of time, followed by microseconds (1 μs = 1,000 ns) and milliseconds (1 ms = 1,000 μs = 1,000,000 ns). Each unit represents a progressively larger duration of time.

Flashcard 3:
Question: What does ""jsonl"" stand for?
Answer: ""jsonl"" stands for Newline-delimited JSON, a file format where each line is valid JSON. It allows for efficient parsing and reading of JSON data from a file or stream.

Flashcard 4:
Question: How can you quickly compute 2^x?
Answer: To quickly compute 2^x, you can use the bitwise left-shift operator. The expression 1 << x represents 1 left-shifted by x, which is the equivalent of 2 raised to the power of x.

Flashcard 5:
Question: What is RPC?
Answer: RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call, a protocol that enables one program to request a service from another program located on a separate computer within a network. RPC abstracts the network details, allowing programs to communicate without explicit knowledge of the underlying network.","[Front: What does ""eager execution"" mean?

Note: Set 4 flashcards require graphical or diagrammatic representation and cannot be transcribed as textual notes. Proper illustrations, such as diagrams of WebAssembly, DRAM controller, and the hierarchy of computing, should be included to convey the information accurately.

Flashcard 1:
Question: How can you represent 2.75 in binary?
Answer: The binary representation of 2.75 is not mentioned in the flashcards.

Flashcard 2:
Question: How do we represent 0.1 (one-tenth) in binary?
Answer: The flashcard states that representing 0.1 in binary is unclear due to the representation of fractional values in binary being either too large (1/2 or 0.5) or too small (1/16 or 0.0625). The flashcard suggests that representing 0.1 may require multiple fractions to sum up, such as 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64.

"Textbook Excerpt - Hashing and Data Centers:

Hashing Scheme:
- There are three main ways to pick a hashing scheme:
  1. Random: This involves using methods like modulo and is the most common approach.
  2. Ordered: In this approach, the hashing scheme is determined based on a specific order, such as user ID by signup date.
  3. Learned: This approach involves using a counting-based method to determine the hashing scheme.

General Definition of Hashing:
- Hashing can be defined as a mapping from objects to numeric values. It allows for efficient retrieval and storage of data.

Overhead in Data Centers:
- In the context of data centers, overhead refers to everything that the center is doing other than computing. This includes tasks such as performing IO, waiting for resources to be allocated to a job, and waiting for the job to get scheduled.

Modeling with OOP vs. Functional Programming:
- The main difference between modeling with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming is the approach to API design.
- In OOP, a class-based API is utilized, where class methods can access arbitrary parts of the class state.
- Conversely, a functional API in Functional Programming builds policies from loosely coupled pure functions.

VMs vs. Containers:
- An analogy to understand VMs and containers is that VMs are like houses, while containers are like apartments.
- VMs provide separate hardware for each application, ensuring strong isolation at the cost of higher resource utilization.
- Containers, on the other hand, share the underlying OS and kernel, resulting in lower resource utilization but weaker isolation.

High Bandwidth Memory (HBM):
- HBM is a high-performance RAM interface used in conjunction with high-performance graphics accelerators and network devices.
- It is a 3D-stacked SDRAM that offers significant bandwidth advantages for data-intensive applications.

bfloat:
- bfloat is a lossy compression technique used to reduce bandwidth requirements during network communications of machine learning weights and activations.
- Compared to IEEE fp32 and fp16, bfloat16 requires significantly fewer full adders, providing improved efficiency.

Differentiable Programming:
- Differentiable Programming is a way of extending Deep Learning beyond traditional neural networks.
- It involves assembling parameterized functional blocks and training them from examples using some form of gradient-based optimization.
- A differentiable program is parameterized, automatically differentiated, and trainable/optimizable.","[Front: What the 3 ways to pick a hashing scheme? Back: 1. Random - eg: modulo, most common 2. Ordered - eg: user id by signup date 3. Learned - eg: count based],

"Textbook Excerpt - Concepts in Functional Programming:

Functor:
- A better word for functor is ""mappable."" A mappable entity can be applied a function to transform its elements.

Catamorphism:
- The term ""collapsible"" is a better word for catamorphism. A catamorphism represents the collapse or reduction of a higher-order structure.

Monad:
- ""Chainable"" is a better word for monad. A chainable entity allows for the sequential execution of computations.

Monoid:
- The term ""aggregatable"" is a better word for monoid. A monoid represents a set of elements that can be combined to produce a single element.

Notional Machine:
- The notional machine acts as a model that bridges the gap between source code and the actual machine executing it.

Page (Computer Memory):
- In virtual memory management, a page refers to a fixed-length contiguous block of virtual memory.
- It serves as the smallest unit of data for memory management in a virtual memory operating system.

Gray Failure:
- Gray failure refers to a situation where a system keeps working but is severely degraded.
- Unlike black failure, which indicates a completely non-functioning system, gray failure describes a system that is partially operational.
- Gray failure is commonly observed in automation, distributed systems, and machine learning.","[Front: What is a better word for functor? Back: Mappable],

"Textbook Excerpt - Binary Trees and Functional Programming:

Inorder for Binary Tree:
- In general, the inorder traversal of a binary tree follows the pattern of Left -> Root -> Right.
- For the given tree G->D->H->B->E->A->F->C, the inorder traversal would be G->D->H->B->E->A->F->C.

Preorder for Binary Tree:
- In general, the preorder traversal of a binary tree follows the pattern of Root -> Left -> Right.
- For the given tree A->B->D->G->H->E->C->F, the preorder traversal would be A->B->D->G->H->E->C->F.

Post-order for Binary Tree:
- In general, the post-order traversal of a binary tree follows the pattern of Left -> Right -> Root.
- For the given tree G->H->D->E->B->F->C->A, the post-order traversal would be G->H->D->E->B->F->C->A.

Advantage of Functional Programming Mindset:
- The functional programming mindset tends to reduce the amount of global or spread-around state.
- This reduction in state improves the ease of testing and facilitates quicker iterations during the development process.

Backpressure for Stream Processing:
- Backpressure refers to the resistance or force opposing the desired flow of data through software.
- In stream processing, backpressure can occur when the rate of data consumption exceeds the rate of data production.
- Strategies such as controlling the producer, buffering, and dropping samples can be employed to handle backpressure effectively.

Snowflake Schema for OLAP:
- The snowflake schema is a star table that allows for joins between dimensions.
- It provides a more normalized structure compared to the traditional star schema, leading to improved data integrity and flexibility.","[Front: In general, what is inorder for binary tree? What is inorder this tree? Back: Left -> Root -> Right G->D->H->B->E->A->F->C],
