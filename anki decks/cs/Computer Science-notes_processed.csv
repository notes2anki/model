What is a Computer Program?,A computer program is a set of instructions that we want a computer to perform.
What is an Algorithm?,"The step by step process that we want a program to accomplish. i.e. If we want to write a computer program to toast a piece of bread, we would first write an algorithm. This algorithm might look something like this: 1. Take the bread out of the bag. 2. Place the bread in the toaster. 3. Press the toast button. 4. Wait for the toast to pop up. 5. Remove the toast from the toaster. At first glance, this algorithm seems to solve our problem. However, our algorithm leaves out many details and makes many assumptions, for example: 1. What kind of toast does our user want? Does the user want white bread, wheat, or some other kind of bread? 2. How does the user want the bread toasted, light or dark? 3. What does the user want on the bread after it is toasted: butter, margarine, honey, or strawberry jam? 4. Maybe the user wanted another kind of toast, like French toast or garlic toast, which is prepared by means other than a toaster. 5. Does this algorithm work for all your users in their cultures and languages? Now, you might be thinking we are getting too detailed for just doing a simple toast program. Over the years, software development has the reputation of taking too long, costing too much, and not being what the user wants. This reputation came to be because computer programmers often start writing their programs before they have really thought through their algorithms."
What is Design Requirements?,"The key ingredients to making successful applications starts with design requirements. Design requirements can be very formal and detailed or a simple list on a piece of paper. The importance of design requirements is they help the developer flesh out what the application should do and not do when complete. Design requirements should not be completed in a programmer’s vacuum but should be a collaboration between developers, users, and customers. Design requirements usually begin by asking clients, customers, and or stakeholders how the application should work, what problems it should solve, and how the app should solve the problem. Requirements can include long or short narrative descriptions of the app, screen mockups, and formulas."
User Interface?,"key ingredient to your successful app is the user interface (UI) design. Many software developers start with the UI design, and after laying out all the screen elements and having many users look at paper mock-ups, they then write out the design requirements from their screen layouts. Once you have done your best to flesh out all the design requirements, laid out all the user interface screens, and had the client(s) or potential customers look at your design and give you feedback, coding can begin. Once coding begins, design requirements and user interface screens can change, but the changes are typically minor and easily accommodated by the development process."
What is a Bug?,"After programming, we need to make sure our program 1) matches the design requirements 2) user interface design 3) there are no errors. In programming vernacular, errors are called bugs."
What is Quality Assurance (QA)?,Someone who is experienced in software testing methodology and who didn’t write the app performs this testing. Software testing is commonly referred to as Quality Assurance (QA).
Debugging?,"During the testing phase, the developer will need to work with QA staff to determine why the application is not working as designed. The process is called debugging. Frequently during testing and debugging, changes to the requirements (design) need to occur to make the application more usable for the customer. Once the design requirements and user interface changes are made, the process begins over again."
Object Oriented Proramming (OOP)?,"a programming paradigm that represents concepts as ""objects"" that have data fields (attributes that describe the object) associated procedures known as methods. \ Objects, which are usually instances of classes, are used to interact with one another to design applications and computer programs."

What is an Integrated Development Environment?,"A computer programmer that records input, sends to interpreter, and receives output"
A bit?,the basic unit of information used by computers to store and manipulate data. A bit has a value of either 0 or 1.
Moore's Law,"the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years. In 1965, the cofounder of Intel, Gordon E. Moore, described the trend of transistors in a processor. He observed that the number of transistors in a processor doubled every 18 months from 1958 to 1965, and would likely continue “for at least 18 months.” The observation became famously known as “Moore’s Law” and has proven accurate for more than 55 years."
What is a byte?,"A byte is composed of 8 bits, a convenient power of 2. Whereas a bit can two different values, a byte can represent up to 256 different values."
What is a binary number system?,"The binary number system represents numerical symbols, 0 and 1."
What is a Hexadecimal?,"Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system. It uses 16 distinct symbols, 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, and F to represent values 10 to 15. For example, the hexadecimal number 2AF3 is equal to the decimal number 10995."
What is Unicode?,"Representing characters with a byte worked great for computers until about the 1990s, when the personal computer became widely adopted in non-Western countries where languages have more than 256 characters. Instead of a one-byte character set, Unicode can have up to a 4 bytes character set. The first 256 code points are indicial to the ASCII character table. Unicode can have different character encodings."
What is data types?,"A data type (or datatype) is a classification identifying one of various types of data, such as floating-point, integer, or Boolean, that states: the possible values for that type; the operations that can be done on that type; and the way the values of that type are stored Simple term: A data type is simply the declaration to our program that defines the data we want to store."
A variable?,"A variable is used to store our data and is declared with an associated data type. All data is stored in a variable, and the variable has to have a variable type."
What is boolean logic?,"Is a system for logical operations. Boolean logic uses binary operators like AND, OR, and the unary operator NOT to determine if your conditions are met."
XOR Truth Table?,...... The operator XOR yields TRUE result if only one of the operands is TRUE.
"Truth Table? AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR?",A truth table is mathematical table used in logic to evaluate Boolean operators. They are helpful when trying to determine all the possibilities of a Boolean operator. Operatot = AND: OR: XOR: NAND: NOR: T Op T = T T F F F T Op F = F T T T F F Op T = F T T T F F Op F = F F F T T
Comparison Operators?,"Comparison of different data items is accomplished with comparison operators. These operators produce a logical TRUE or FALSE result. i.e. >,<, >=, <=,==, !="
Pseudo-code?,a high-level description of an algorithm we are trying to solve it does express the algorithm that is necessary to solve the problem at hand but does not contain the necessary programming syntax for coding.
What is a loop?,"A loop is a sequence of program statements, which is specified once but can be repeated several times in succession. Count-controlled: repeat a specified number of times Condition-controlled: until some condition occurs"
What is scope?,The context in which an object exists. depends on where the object is declared and how it’s used. maybe the life of the program or a function or method.
Purpose of getters and setters?,"Outside of an object, a instance variable is not visible at all. Outside of objects we need to be able to access these instance variables as well. How with getters and setters. A getter is a method that returns the value of something in the object, typically an instance variable like the author variable from the Book object. A setter is a method that updates or sets that instance variable."

After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition operation. 3. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-list of elements with smaller values and separately the sub-list of elements with greater values. quicksort(A, i, k): if i < k: p := partition(A, i, k) quicksort(A, i, p - 1) quicksort(A, p + 1, k)"

The speedup of a program using multiple processors in parallel computing is limited by the time needed for the sequential fraction of the program. For example, if a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular portion of the program which takes one hour to execute cannot be parallelized, while the remaining 19 hours (95%) of execution time can be parallelized, then regardless of how many processors are devoted to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time cannot be less than that critical one hour. Hence the speedup is limited to at most 20×."

What is the software tools approach?,depends more on how the programs fit into the programming environment and how they can be used with other programs than on how they are designed internally
What is the design rule of Moduarity?,"Developers should build a program out of simple parts connected by well defined interfaces, so problems are local, and parts of the program can be replaced in future versions to support new features. This rule aims to save time on debugging code that is complex, long, and unreadable."
What is the design rule of clarity?,"Developers should write programs as if the most important communication is to the developer, including themself, who will read and maintain the program rather than the computer. This rule aims to make code readable and comprehensible for whoever works on the code in future."
What is the design rule of Composition?,"Developers should write programs that can communicate easily with other programs. This rule aims to allow developers to break down projects into small, simple programs rather than overly complex monolithic programs."
What is the design rule of Separation?,Developers should separate the mechanisms of the programs from the policies of the programs. One method is to divide a program into a front-end interface and back-end engine that interface communicates with. This rule aims to let policies be changed without destabilizing mechanisms and consequently reducing the number of bugs.
What is the design rule of Simplicity?,"Developers should design for simplicity by looking for ways to break up program systems into small, straightforward cooperating pieces. This rule aims to discourage developers’ affection for writing “intricate and beautiful complexities” that are in reality bug prone programs."
What is the design rule of Parsimony?,Developers should avoid writing big programs. This rule aims to prevent overinvestment of development time in failed or suboptimal approaches caused by the owners of the program’s reluctance to throw away visibly large pieces of work. Smaller programs are not only easier to optimize and maintain. They are easier to delete when deprecated.
What is the design rule of Transparency?,Developers should design for visibility and discoverability by writing in a way that their thought process can lucidly be seen by future developers working on the project and using input and output formats that make it easy to identify valid input and correct output.

This rule aims to make programs more readable for any developer working on the project, which allows the program to be maintained."
What is the design rule of Least Surprise?,"Developers should design programs that build on top of the potential users' expected knowledge; for example, ‘+’ should always mean addition in a calculator program. This rule aims to encourage developers to build intuitive products that are easy to use."

What is the design rule of Repair?,Developers should design programs that fail in a manner that is easy to localize and diagnose or in other words “fail noisily”. This rule aims to prevent incorrect output from a program from becoming an input and corrupting the output of other code undetected.
What is the design rule of Economy?,"Developers should value developer time over machine time, because machine cycles today are relatively inexpensive compared to prices in the 1970s. This rule aims to reduce development costs of projects."
What is the design rule of Generation?,Developers should avoid writing code by hand and instead write abstract high-level programs that generate code. This rule aims to reduce human errors and save time.
What is the design rule of Optimization?,Developers should prototype software before polishing it. This rule aims to prevent developers from spending too much time for marginal gains.
What is the design rule of Diversity?,"Developers should design their programs to be flexible and open. This rule aims to make programs flexible, allowing them to be used in other ways than their developers intended."
What is the design rule of Extensibility?,"Developers should design for the future by making their protocols extensible, allowing for easy plugins without modification to the program's architecture by other developers, noting the version of the program, and more. This rule aims to extend the lifespan and enhance the utility of the code the developer writes."

"Integers are stored, in memory, as a series of bits For example, the number 6 stored as a 32-bit int would be:",00000000 00000000 00000000 00000110
Shifting this bit pattern to the left one position (6 << 1) would result in the number _______.,"12 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001100 As you can see, the digits have shifted to the left by one position, and the last digit on the right is filled with a zero. You might also note that shifting left is equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2."

"""bitwise"" operators","instead of treating that number as if it were a single value, they treat it as if it were a string of bits, written in twos-complement binary Two's Complement binary for Positive Integers: 0 is written as ""0"" 1 is written as ""1"" 2 is written as ""10"" 3 is ""11"" 4 is ""100"" 5 is ""101"""
twos-complement binary representation for negative numbers,"Negative numbers are written with a leading one instead of a leading zero. So if you are using only 8 bits for your twos-complement numbers, then you treat patterns from ""00000000"" to ""01111111"" as the whole numbers from 0 to 127, and reserve ""1xxxxxxx"" for writing negative numbers. A negative number, -x, is written using the bit pattern for (x-1) with all of the bits complemented (switched from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1). So -1 is complement(1 - 1) = complement(0) = ""11111111"", and -10 is complement(10 - 1) = complement(9) = complement(""00001001"") = ""11110110"". This means that negative numbers go all the way down to -128 (""10000000""). Negative numbers are represented by performing the two's complement operation on their absolute value."
x << y,Returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y places (and new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros). Same as multiplying x by 2**y.

defensive programming,works under unforeseen circumstances
S.O.L.I.D.,"Object-oriented programming and design Single-responsibility principle a single responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software Open-closed principle Possible to extend the functionality of a class (open), but not to modify the class itself (closed) Liskov substitution principle Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub-types without altering the correctness of that program. Interface segregation principle Split interfaces which are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that any implementation only will have to know about the methods that are of interest to them. Dependency Inversion Principle 1) Defensive programming The main purposes of defensive programming is to ensure that a piece of code works under unforeseen circumstances, to improve comprehension and predictability and to simplify maintenance. To program defensively, make sure each method (as well as class, variable and property where applicable): * Has a clear and single purpose * Has a clear name with a clear intent (that matches the implementation) * Does not have any unexpected side effects (i.e. it should not perform operations that is not to be expected) * Is short and concise * Is testable * Validates input * Handles exceptions * Has a clear contract * Has sensible return values * Does not have any leaky abstractions (internal details and limitations should be kept internal) * Use comments (with moderation) to explain why things are done (if you feel that you need to explain how something is done you should consider refactor the code instead) Also, make sure that your code follows best practice guidelines, methodologies and programming techniques so that other programmers (and yourself after some time) easily can grasp how the code works. 2) Unit testing Unit testing will reduce the number of bugs in production, make it less risky to change and refactor code and will prevent any regressions to reoccur. When done right, it can also make you write better code. Sure, it can be tedious work and it takes time to write but it is totally worth it. Read more about unit testing here: http://www.codeaddiction.net/articles/23/introduction-to-unit-testing-in-c 3) Adhere to the SOLID-principles S.O.L.I.D. is an acronym that states five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design. These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to refactor code and avoid code smell. S.O.L.I.D stands for (very simply put): Single-responsibility principle Every class should have a single responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. If a class has more than one ""reason to change"" (i.e. it tries to solve many problems) it should be split up. Open-closed principle It should be possible to extend the functionality of a class (open), but not to modify the class itself (closed). Here's an example of what the ""closed-part"" means: A method (MakeJuice) is taking objects as parameters that implements a specific interface (IFruit). When done right, we should be able to create new types of fruit and run it though MakeJuice without needing to change the implementation of the method, this means that it is ""closed"". Liskov substitution principle Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub-types without altering the correctness of that program. Interface segregation principle Split interfaces which are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that any implementation only will have to know about the methods that are of interest to them. Dependency Inversion Principle If a class X depends on a another class Y, make sure that the dependency is done through an interface. This means that you can replace Y with another implementation without having to change X."

When you open your eyes, you are pointing directly at one of the children, Peter Pivot. You say, “Quickly! Everybody shorter than Peter, come stand over here. And everybody taller than Peter, go stand over there. If you're the same height as Peter, you can go into either group.” The children shuffle around, and soon they are standing in the two groups. You count and find 120 children in the shorter group, and 79 children in the taller group. You know the 98th shortest child must be in the shorter group, so you tell Peter and the 79 taller children to sit in the bleachers. You again close your eyes, stick out your finger, and spin around three times. When you open your eyes, you are pointing directly at Peter's sister, Paula Pivot. You say, “Quickly! Those of you who are still standing. If you're shorter than Paula, come stand over here. If you're taller than Paula, go stand over there. If you're the same height, you can go into either group.” The children shuffle around, and soon they are standing in the two groups. You count and find 59 children in the shorter group, and 60 children in the taller group. You know the 98th shortest child must be in the taller group, so you tell Paula and the 59 shorter children to sit in the bleachers. You again close your eyes, stick out your finger, and spin around three times. When you open your eyes, you are pointing directly at Paula's cousin, Prudence Pivot. You say, “Quickly! Those of you who are still standing. If you're shorter than Prudence, come stand over here. If you're taller than Prudence, go stand over there. If you're the same height, you can go into either group.” The children shuffle around, and soon they are standing in the two groups. You count and find 37 children in the shorter group, and 22 children in the taller group. You know that Paula and 59 other shorter children are sitting on the bleachers. Along with the 37 shorter children still standing, you know that a total of 97 children are shorter than Prudence. Therefore, Prudence is the 98th shortest child!"

Working with a file generally means looking at the individual pages it contains (corresponding to bytes in a cache line). But unless they’re on your desk, files are just treated as a unit. You always grab whole files at a time, even if there’s only one page in them that you actually care about right now. Also in the office is a filing cabinet (L2 cache). That cabinet contains files you’ve handled recently, but aren’t using right now. When you’re done with what’s on your desk, most of these files will go back into that filing cabinet. Grabbing something from the cabinet isn’t immediate – you need to walk up there, open the right drawer and thumb through a few index cards to find the right file – but it’s still pretty quick."

She is then provisionally ""engaged"" to the suitor she most prefers so far, and that suitor is likewise provisionally engaged to her. In each subsequent round, first a) each unengaged man proposes to the most-preferred woman to whom he has not yet proposed (regardless of whether the woman is already engaged), and then b) each woman replies ""maybe"" if she is currently not engaged or if she prefers this guy over her current provisional partner (in this case, she rejects her current provisional partner who becomes unengaged). The provisional nature of engagements preserves the right of an already-engaged woman to ""trade up"" (and, in the process, to ""jilt"" her until-then partner). This process is repeated until everyone is engaged."
