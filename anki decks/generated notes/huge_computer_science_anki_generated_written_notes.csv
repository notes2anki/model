9. Building a heap in linear time: Building a heap can be done in linear time by leveraging the property that a tree of size n nodes will have floor(n/2^h) nodes with height >= h. The last half of nodes in the tree are already leaves, so no work needs to be done on them. By going bottom-up and satisfying the heap property one level at a time, each level up the tree requires at most one additional operation compared to the level below it. This results in a time complexity of O(n) for building the heap.

The last half of nodes will be leaves, so they already satisfy the heap property. No work needs to be done on them. going bottom-up (ignoring the last n/2 items) and satisfying the heap property one level at a time, each level going up the tree has to do at most 1 operation more than the level below it. But as you go up the tree, higher levels have fewer nodes, so you may be doing more operations, but it happens on fewer number of times. This resembles a series:  n/2 - height 1: 1 operations n/4 - height 2: 2 operation n/8 - height 3: 3 operations ... going to floor(n/2^h) - height h: h operations  n * (1/2 + 2/4 + 3/8 + 4/16 ....) = n * 1 = n]"

4. What is a Binary Search Tree?
   - A binary tree is a data structure where each node has a comparable key and satisfies the restriction that the key in any node is larger than the keys in all nodes in that node's left subtree and smaller than the keys in all nodes in that node's right subtree.

5. What is an AVL tree?
   - An AVL tree is a balanced binary search tree where the height of every node and that of its sibling differ by at most 1.

6. What is a red-black tree?
   - A red-black tree is a type of binary search tree that satisfies the following properties:
     - Red links lean left.
     - No node has two links connected to it.
     - The tree has perfect black balance: every path from the root to a null link has the same number of blacks.

7. What is a splay tree?
   - A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree where recently accessed elements are moved to the root so they are quick to access again.

8. What is a treap?
   - A treap is a data structure that combines properties of binary search trees and heaps. Each key in the tree has a random priority assigned to it. It must maintain two properties:
     - The keys are in order with respect to their values, as in a typical binary search tree.
     - The keys are in heap order with respect to their priorities, which means no key has a key of lower priority as an ancestor. It provides O(log N) expected time for all operations and O(N) worst case time complexity.

[Front: What is typical cache line size? Back: 64 bytes.  -- extra below --  To know the sizes, you need to look it up using the documentation for the processor, afaik there is no programatic way to do it. On the plus side however, most cache lines are of a standard size, based on intels standards. On x86 cache lines are 64 bytes, however, to prevent false sharing, you need to follow the guidelines of the processor you are targeting (intel has some special notes on its netburst based processors), generally you need to align to 64 bytes for this (intel states that you should also avoid crossing 16 byte boundries).  To do this in C or C++ requires that you use aligned_malloc or one of the compiler specific specifiers such as __attribute__((align(64))) or __declspec(align(64)). To pad between members in a struct to split them onto different cache lines, you need on insert a member big enough to align it to the next 64 byte boundery]"
"1. Latency is the delay from input into a system to the desired outcome. It represents the time interval between a stimulus and response.

2. A y-fast trie is a data structure used for storing integers from a bounded domain. It provides support for exact and predecessor or successor queries. The time complexity for these operations is O(log log M), where M is the maximum value in the domain. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of stored values. The y-fast trie was proposed by Dan Willard in 1982 as an improvement over the x-fast trie, reducing the space usage.

"1. A van Emde Boas tree, also known as a vEB tree, is a tree-based data structure that supports efficient insertions, deletions, lookups, successor queries, and predecessor queries. It achieves a time complexity of O(log log U), where U represents the universe of items to store. The items are organized into clusters of size sqrt(U). The structure consists of clusters, each being a smaller vEB structure of size sqrt(n). Additionally, there is a ""summary"" structure that keeps track of nonempty clusters. The vEB tree was developed by Peter van Emde Boas and his team in 1975.

2. A compressed trie is a variation of the trie data structure in which non-branching paths are compressed into a single edge. This compression technique reduces the space required to store the trie by eliminating redundant nodes.

3. With a hash table, the ordering of the keys is lost. Hash tables provide efficient lookup operations based on keys, but they do not preserve the original order of the keys.

4. To convert a file separated by spaces into a newline-delimited format and then sort it alphabetically, you can use the following sed command: sed 's/ /\n/g' words.txt | sort

5. To print columns 2, 3, and 6 from the output of the date command, you can use the following awk command: date | awk '{print $2, $3, $6}'

6. To change a file delimited by colons (:) into a tab-delimited format, you can use the following sed command: cat /etc/passwd | sed 's/:/\t/g'

7. To output a file with line numbers, you can use the cat command with the -n option: cat -n somefile

Back: The van Emde Boas tree supports insertions, deletions, lookups, successor queries, and predecessor queries in time O(log log U), where U is the universe of items to store. Items are stored in clusters of size sqrt(U).   The van Emde Boas data structure divides the range {0,...,n−1} into blocks of size sqrt(n), which we call clusters. Each cluster is itself a vEB structure of size sqrt(n). In addition, there is a “summary” structure that keeps track of which clusters are nonempty.  More detail: A van Emde Boas tree (or van Emde Boas priority queue), also known as a vEB tree, is a tree data structure which implements an associative array with m-bit integer keys. It performs all operations in O(log m) time, or equivalently in O(log log M) time, where M = 2m is the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the tree. The M is not to be confused with the actual number of elements stored in the tree, by which the performance of other tree data-structures is often measured. The vEB tree has good space efficiency when it contains a large number of elements, as discussed below. It was invented by a team led by Dutch computer scientist Peter van Emde Boas in 1975.],

2. In what case would perfect hashing be practical?
   - When you don't need to support inserts or deletes. The data is static.

3. How does perfect hashing handle collisions?
   - It creates a second hash table in the buckets where there are multiple items (k), using a second hash function, and k^2 space. The hash table has two hashing levels. k^2 is chosen because the Markov inequality (birthday paradox) ensures we will not have collisions in bucket.

3. Downsides of using an adjacency matrix to represent a graph: There are two main downsides of using an adjacency matrix. First, finding all the outgoing edges from a vertex takes O(n) time even if there aren't very many edges. Second, the space cost is high for ""sparse graphs,"" those with much fewer than n^2 edges, as it requires O(n^2) space.

4. When using an adjacency list is expensive: Finding predecessors of a node u can be extremely expensive when using adjacency lists. It requires looking through every list of every node in time O(n + e), where e is the total number of edges. However, if finding predecessors is a frequently performed operation, we can store a second copy of the graph with the edges reversed to optimize this.

5. When adjacency lists are most useful: Adjacency lists are most useful when we mostly want to enumerate outgoing edges of each node. This is common in search tasks, where we want to find a path from one node to another or compute the distances between pairs of nodes. If other operations are important, we can optimize them by augmenting the adjacency list representation.

"1. What is the memory needed to store an adjacency list?
   - Answer: Theta( |V| + |E| )
   - Explanation: Storing an adjacency list requires memory proportional to the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The adjacency list consists of an array of |V| elements, each containing a list of neighbors for the corresponding vertex. The total memory required is proportional to the sum of the number of vertices and edges.

2. What is the memory needed to store an adjacency matrix?
   - Answer: Theta(|V|^2)
   - Explanation: Storing an adjacency matrix requires memory proportional to the square of the number of vertices in the graph. The adjacency matrix is a 2D array of |V| x |V| elements, where each element represents the presence or absence of an edge between two vertices.

3. How would you implement a queue with a linked list?
   - Answer: Use a tail pointer. Push new items at the tail, pop items at the head. Both operations are constant-time.
   - Explanation: To implement a queue with a linked list, we can use a tail pointer to keep track of the last element in the queue. New items are pushed at the tail by creating a new node and updating the tail pointer. Items are popped from the head by removing the first node and updating the head pointer. Both push and pop operations can be done in constant time.

4. How would you implement a stack with a linked list?
   - Answer: Push and pop items at the head. Both operations are constant-time.
   - Explanation: To implement a stack with a linked list, we can push items at the head of the linked list and pop items from the head as well. Push operation involves creating a new node and updating the head pointer. Pop operation involves removing the first node and updating the head pointer. Both push and pop operations can be done in constant time.

5. What preference of nodes vs leaves does preorder traversal give on a tree?
   - Answer: Nodes first, leaves later.
   - Explanation: Preorder traversal visits the nodes of a tree before visiting its leaves. It starts at the root and then recursively visits the left subtree in preorder traversal, followed by the right subtree in preorder traversal.

6. What preference of nodes vs leaves does postorder traversal give on a tree?
   - Answer: Leaves first, internal nodes later.
   - Explanation: Postorder traversal visits the leaves of a tree before visiting its internal nodes. It starts at the leftmost leaf and then recursively visits the leaves in postorder traversal, followed by visiting the internal nodes.

7. What could you use in DFS to turn a recursive algorithm into an iterative one?

"1. Using a stack to keep track of unvisited nodes gives what kind of traversal?
   - Answer: DFS
   - Explanation: Using a stack to keep track of unvisited nodes during a graph traversal results in Depth-First Search (DFS). This is because the stack follows the principle of ""last-in, first-out"" and explores the neighbors of the most recently visited node in a recursive manner.

2. Using a queue to keep track of unvisited nodes gives what kind of traversal?
   - Answer: BFS
   - Explanation: Using a queue to keep track of unvisited nodes during a graph traversal results in Breadth-First Search (BFS). This is because the queue follows the principle of ""first-in, first-out"" and explores the neighbors of the least recently visited node in a level-by-level manner.

3. In a highly connected graph of n vertices, how many cycles can there be?

   - Explanation: In a highly connected graph with n vertices, there can be a maximum of (n - 1)! cycles. Enumerating all cycles in such a graph can be done using techniques like backtracking, but the number of cycles can be extremely large. Therefore, it is important to consider the computational complexity when dealing with highly connected graphs.","[Front: Using a stack to keep track of unvisited nodes gives what kind of traversal?

"1. What can you use to find if a graph is bipartite?
   - Answer: BFS. Using only 2 colors. When you encounter a new vertex, if it has no color, give it the opposite color of its parent vertex. If it is already colored the same, the graph is not bipartite.
   - Explanation: To determine if a graph is bipartite, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) with 2 colors. We assign one color (e.g., red) to the starting vertex and its neighbors with the opposite color (e.g., blue). During the BFS traversal, if we encounter a new vertex without a color, we assign it the opposite color of its parent vertex. If we encounter a vertex that is already colored with the same color as its parent, then the graph is not bipartite.

2. How can you find a cycle in a graph?
   - Answer: DFS. If you discover an edge that connects to an ancestor (previously discovered vertex), you have a cycle.
   - Explanation: To find a cycle in a graph, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS). While traversing the graph, if we encounter an edge that connects to a previously discovered vertex (ancestor), then a cycle exists in the graph.

3. What is an articulation vertex?
   - Answer: A vertex of a graph whose deletion disconnects the graph.
   - Explanation: An articulation vertex, also known as a cut vertex, is a vertex in a graph whose removal would result in the disconnection of the graph into multiple connected components. Removing an articulation vertex increases the number of connected components in the graph.

4. How can you find an articulation vertex?
   - Answer: DFS multiple times. Remove each edge one at a time, doing a DFS after each, to see if you end up with > 1 connected components. If you remove a node and then DFS and find you have fewer than m - 1 edges, you've deleted an articulation vertex. O(n(n+m)). A faster way, with a little more bookkeeping, can be done in O(n+m) time, if you do DFS and keep track of parents and make a note when you reach a back edge, which connects to an ancestor.
   - Explanation: To find an articulation vertex, we can perform multiple Depth-First Searches (DFS) on the graph. By removing each edge one at a time and performing a DFS after each removal, we can determine if the removal of a vertex creates more than one connected component. If removing a vertex results in fewer than m - 1 edges during the subsequent DFS, the removed vertex is an articulation vertex. This approach has a time complexity of O(n(n+m)). A faster way to find articulation vertices, with additional bookkeeping, can be done in O(n+m) time by keeping track of parents during DFS and identifying back edges that connect to an ancestor.

5. How could you identify errors in a DNA fragment assembly given many pairs of sequences, where item A must appear before B in the larger sequence?
   - Answer: Build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing all the left-right constraints. Any topological sort of the DAG is a consistent ordering. If there are cycles, there must be errors.
   - Explanation: To identify errors in DNA fragment assembly based on left-right constraints, we can construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where each fragment sequence is represented as a vertex, and the constraints are represented as directed edges from A to B if A must appear before B. By performing a topological sort on the DAG, we can obtain a consistent ordering of the fragment sequences. If there are cycles in the DAG, it indicates that there are errors in the assembly, as the constraints cannot be satisfied without violating the ordering","[Front: What can use to find if a graph is bipartite?

3. What should you avoid in your base case in recursion?
In recursion, it is important to avoid having too many base case scenarios. It is usually best to have only one base case so that the recursion can return as quickly as possible. It is also important to avoid ""arm's length"" recursion, where the base case is far removed from the recursive calls.

4. What is the bandwidth of a graph?
The bandwidth of a graph refers to the largest edge in the permutation that gives you the shortest edges. It is used to measure the width of a graph when represented using an adjacency matrix.

5. When talking about dynamic programming, what is feasibility?
In dynamic programming, feasibility refers to the rules or constraints that an algorithm must adhere to in reaching its solution. Feasibility is an important aspect of dynamic programming as it helps determine if a particular solution or subproblem is valid or not.

6. When talking about dynamic programming, what is optimality?
In dynamic programming, optimality refers to the property of an algorithm where the subsolutions of an optimal solution to a problem are themselves optimal solutions for their respective subproblems. This means that by solving smaller subproblems optimally, we can build up to an optimal solution for the larger problem.

7. What is dynamic programming?
Dynamic programming is a general-purpose algorithm design technique that is most often used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It involves breaking down a big instance of a problem into smaller instances and solving each instance in a bottom-up manner, storing the results in a table as we go. Dynamic programming is based on the principle of delaying commitment to particular choices in order to preserve alternative solutions that may be needed later. It is efficient when there are duplicate subproblems that can be avoided and when the subproblems can be enumerated in a suitable manner.

8. What is the complexity for a naive recursive Fibonacci function?

[Front: What is dynamic programming? Back: Dynamic programming is a general-purpose algorithm design technique that is most often used to solve combinatorial optimization problems, where we are looking for the best possible input to some function chosen from an exponentially large search space.  There are two parts to dynamic programming. The first part is a programming technique: dynamic programming is essentially divide and conquer run in reverse: we solve a big instance of a problem by breaking it up recursively into smaller instances; but instead of carrying out the computation recursively from the top down, we start from the bottom with the smallest instances of the problem, solving each increasingly large instance in turn and storing the result in a table. The second part is a design principle: in building up our table, we are careful always to preserve alternative solutions we may need later, by delaying commitment to particular choices to the extent that we can.  The bottom-up aspect of dynamic programming is most useful when a straightforward recursion would produce many duplicate subproblems. It is most efficient when we can enumerate a class of subproblems that doesn't include too many extraneous cases that we don't need for our original problem.],

3. What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__?
__str__ is a special method in Python that is meant to provide a string representation of an object to make it more human-readable. It is used by the str() built-in function and the print() statement.

__repr__, on the other hand, is a special method that is meant to provide a string representation of an object that is unambiguous and can be used to recreate the object. It is used by the repr() built-in function and is often implemented as the constructor for the object.

In summary, __str__ is meant to be human-readable, while __repr__ is meant to represent the object and be unambiguous.

4. C: Method to find a given item x in a linked list. Head is a List *, x's data type is item_type.
Here is a method in C to find a given item x in a linked list:

List *search_list(List *l, item_type x) {
   if (l == NULL)

   if (l->item == x) 
      return l;
   else 
      return search_list(l->next, x);
}

This method takes a pointer to the head of the linked list and the item to search for. It recursively searches each node in the linked list until it finds a node with the given item or reaches the end of the list. If the item is found, the method returns a pointer to the node. If the end of the list is reached without finding the item, the method returns NULL","[Front: Write a dynamic programming version of computing Fibonacci for n.

"- What is a weak reference in Python?
  - A weak reference to an object does not affect its reference count. When the only remaining references to a referent are weak references, garbage collection is free to destroy the referent and reuse its memory for something else. A primary use for weak references is to implement caches or mappings holding large objects, where it’s desired that a large object not be kept alive solely because it appears in a cache or mapping.
- How does garbage collection work in CPython?
  - CPython uses reference counting and generational garbage collection. There are 3 age stages where objects live in memory. They all start in the ""nursery"", stage0, then if they survive a garbage collection, they are moved to stage1. The oldest objects that continue to survive in stage1 are promoted to stage2. The gc module has thresholds 700, 10, 10 for each stage. In order to decide when to run, the collector keeps track of the number of object allocations and deallocations since the last collection. When the number of allocations minus the number of deallocations exceeds threshold0, collection starts. If generation 0 has been examined more than threshold1 times since generation 1 has been examined, then generation 1 is examined as well. Similarly, threshold2 controls the number of collections of generation 1 before collecting generation 2.
- What is reference counting?
  - Reference counting is a method of garbage collection where the runtime keeps track of references to an object by manipulating the reference count on each assignment and delete (del), and when the reference count reaches 0 it means the object is practically unreachable. When the next collection runs, the object's memory will be reserved to allocate for new objects.
- What is a finalizer in Python?
  - A finalizer is a destructor, named __del__. __del__() is run when the runtime is about to destroy the object.
- What are 2 advantages of reference counting?
  - It is easy to implement and collects garbage incidentally without large pauses in execution.
- What are 2 disadvantages of reference counting?
  - It cannot collect circular references and manipulating reference counts at each assignment is very slow.","[Front: What is a weak reference in Python?

"- What is cyclic garbage collection?
  - Cyclic garbage collection is a method that detects and removes cycles unreachable by the program.
- How is garbage collection done in PyPy?
  - The GC implementation in PyPy is pluggable and can be chosen at runtime. PyPy uses mark and sweep, and generational garbage collection optimization. Marked objects are promoted from the nursery to an older generation. PyPy uses incremental garbage collection, where a major collection is split into multiple passes, each lasting only a few milliseconds.
- How does mark and sweep work?
  - In Java, mark and sweep perform a DFS on the graph of references to objects. This graph can have multiple roots. Each root is a reference that the program can access directly, such as a variable. The traversal marks each object by setting a mark bit. The sweep phase causes unmarked memory to be linked together in a list, so that memory can be reallocated. Sometimes this also triggers compaction, which moves used objects adjacent to each other in memory. The side effect of this is that free memory is also adjacent to free memory, allowing large blocks to be allocated.
- What is copying garbage collection (stop and copy)?
  - Copying garbage collection, also known as stop and copy, splits heap memory into two partitions: an old space and a new space. Live objects are found by performing a DFS of their reference graph and are moved into the new space. The new space becomes the old space, and unreachable objects are left in the old space to be overwritten the next time collection occurs. The movement of objects implicitly compacts the objects. However, one disadvantage is that only half of the heap space can be used","[Front: What is cyclic garbage collection? Back: Detects and removes cycles unreachable by the program.],

"1. How could you implement an LRU cache?
- An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache can be implemented using a fast lookup table like a hash table or binary tree, along with a linked list of items based on their usage. When an item is accessed or added, it is deleted from the linked list and added to the head of the list. To prune the cache, the linked list is traversed to remove trailing elements, which are also deleted from the storage (tree or hash table). Alternatively, a splay tree can be used as it moves accesses to the root. To prune items, the leaves can be identified and removed since the number of leaves will be approximately n/2.

2. What is a direct mapped cache?
- A direct mapped cache is a type of cache used in the CPU. It involves using the lower order bits of a given memory address modulo the number of cache lines to place or lookup data in the cache. If there is a collision, the existing data is overwritten.

3. What is a fully-associative cache?
- A fully-associative cache is another type of cache used in the CPU. In this scheme, lookups are performed on all cache lines in parallel to determine whether there is a hit or a miss. This requires a large number of comparators, which increases the complexity and cost of implementing large caches. Hence, fully-associative caches are typically used for smaller caches (usually less than 4K).

4. Disadvantage of a fully-associative cache?
- There are a few disadvantages to using a fully-associative cache:
  - It is expensive to implement due to the requirement for parallel checks on all cache lines.
  - Implementing this scheme adds complexity to the cache design.

5. How do some processors handle caching for data and instructions?
- Some processors handle caching for data and instructions by having a slightly slower, separate cache for data. This helps in avoiding conflicts between instructions and data, ensuring efficient caching.","[Front: How could you implement an LRU cache?

  - DEFLATE is a lossless compression algorithm based on LZ77. It is used in Gzip, WinZip, and mod_deflate, which is bundled with Apache web server for automated gzip compression of HTTP-served content. It uses LZ77 and Huffman coding.

- How does LZ77-based compression work?
  - LZ77 is a dictionary encoding algorithm that compresses based on the occurrence of repeated strings of characters in the message. It partitions the input into a search buffer and a look-ahead buffer. The search buffer has a maximum size of 32KB. It compares the symbols in the look-ahead buffer with the symbols in the search buffer to find a copy of the symbol. If a match is found, it checks the second symbol of the look-ahead buffer to see if it also matches the predecessor. By detecting long phrases of symbols, it can encode them as one unit. This process implicitly creates a rolling statistical probability for each symbol/phrase.

- What is Huffman encoding?
  - Huffman encoding algorithm analyzes the occurrence of individual symbols and creates a binary tree where common symbols are closest to the root and have fewer bits for encoding. Less common/rare symbols have longer paths on the tree, resulting in longer encodings. By traversing the tree, from root to leaf, and keeping track of 1 or 0 at each node, we can determine the encoding of the symbol.

- What is the primary factor of compression?
  - The primary factor of compression is the probability of redundant portions of input.

Starting with one character in the LA buffer, it looks back in the search buffer to find a copy of the symbol.

"- What is multiprogramming?
  - Multiprogramming is a technique that makes one processor appear as multiple processors, each handling one process at a time. It allows for better utilization of the processor's resources by running multiple programs concurrently.

- What triggers a context switch?
  - A context switch is triggered by various events such as timer interrupt, hardware interrupt, I/O operations where the system is waiting for a read or write to complete, or a voluntary yield by a process. It involves saving the current state of a process and loading the saved state of another process to continue its execution.

- What is dual-mode operation?
  - Dual-mode operation is a feature of a computer's hardware that provides at least two modes: user mode and kernel (also known as supervisor or protected) mode. User mode is used for executing user programs, while kernel mode provides access to privileged instructions and resources of the operating system.

- How does the OS run a program?
  - The operating system runs a program by executing an ""exec"" function from kernel mode (system mode 1). This transition switches the execution mode to system mode 0, also known as user mode. When the program completes or exits, the operating system switches back to kernel mode.","[Front: What is multiprogramming?

"- How does a user program interact with the kernel?
  - A user program interacts with the kernel by making a system call. The program requests a particular service or resource from the operating system, and the kernel takes control, completes the requested action, and returns the result to the user program, switching back to user mode.

- What happens when the hardware needs something to happen?
  - When the hardware needs something to happen, it generates an interrupt. The interrupt signals the operating system, hardware interrupts, timer interrupts, or I/O interrupts. The operating system then takes control, saves the current process state, switches to the appropriate interrupt handler, and once the hardware task is complete, the operating system returns from the interrupt, resuming the execution of the interrupted process.

- What happens when a program makes an exception?
  - When a program encounters an exception, such as a divide by zero error or access to an invalid memory address, it terminates and switches to kernel mode. The kernel then handles the exception, taking appropriate actions such as terminating the program or handling the error.

- What is base and bound?
  - Base and bound is a memory addressing restriction technique where each process is allowed access to the memory between a base address and the bound address plus the base address. Each process has its own base and bound values, defining a dedicated memory region. A drawback of this technique is that the process does not have access to address 0. Address translation can be used to overcome this limitation.

- How does the OS know how to handle an interrupt?
  - The operating system keeps an interrupt vector, which is a table or array in memory, containing information about various types of interrupts. Each interrupt type is associated with an address (pointer) that points to the code in the operating system that handles that particular interrupt. When an interrupt occurs, the processor uses the interrupt vector to locate the appropriate handler code and transfers control to it","[Front: How does a user program interact with the kernel?

"- How is concurrency accomplished?
  - Concurrency is accomplished by multiplexing CPU time.

- What's the difference between parallelism and concurrency?
  - Concurrency means running multiple blocks of instructions independently, while parallelism means running instructions at the same time, as on multiple cores simultaneously.

- What is oversubscription?
  - Oversubscription occurs when more threads are spawned than the available cores.

- What is a race condition?
  - A race condition is when the outcome of a deterministic procedure becomes non-deterministic based on differences in subprocess timing.

- What can you put in place to exclusively use a resource without another process interfering?
  - A mutex or, even better, a lock guard can be used to exclusively use a resource without interference.

- How do you use a mutex in Python?
  - To use a mutex in Python, import the threading module, create a lock object (e.g., lock = threading.Lock()), and then use lock.acquire() to attempt to get access to the resource and lock.release() to release it.

- What does a future do?
  - A future allows us to receive a return value from a function in a child thread.","[Front: How is concurrency accomplished? Back: By multiplexing CPU time.],

"- What is a promise?
  - A promise is a commitment to send a parameter to a child thread's function later.

- What is livelock?
  - Livelock occurs when multiple processes are attempting to deal with the current state but neither makes progress. This can happen during the resolution of a deadlock situation or due to starvation.

- How long does a terminated process stay in the terminated state?
  - A terminated process remains in the terminated state until the parent process does a wait to receive its exit code.

- In Python, what can you use to fork a process?
  - In Python, you can use the multiprocessing module to fork a process. It provides support for process Pool and Process for creating a pool of worker processes or forking temporary subprocesses.

- What does the concurrent.futures module offer?
  - The concurrent.futures module offers ThreadPoolExecutor, ProcessPoolExecutor, Executor objects, and Future objects.

- What is an interrupt?
  - An interrupt is a hardware-invoked context switch where the interrupt handler always runs immediately.

- What happens during an interrupt?
  - During an interrupt, the currently running process' state is saved. The system switches to kernel mode, executes the interrupt handler, and once it completes, returns to user mode, allowing the process to continue.

- What really happens when you fork a process?
  - When a process is forked, it doesn't copy everything but duplicates the page table pointers, initially set at read-only. This mechanism is called copy-on-write.

"- What is the priority inversion problem? 
A thread that is busy-waiting for a lock to be released ends up stealing CPU and getting a higher priority than the thread with the lock. So since the waiting thread gets higher priority, the thread holding the lock can't complete and release the lock.

- What is busy-waiting? 
One or more threads is using a lot of CPU by continuously checking a value, or test&set() checking and writing a value waiting for a lock to release, thus stealing CPU from the thread holding the lock.

- What is a semaphore? 
A semaphore (defined by Dijkstra) is kind of signaling solution for handling concurrency data integrity problems that arise in multi-threaded applications. It has a non-negative integer that supports 2 operations: 
- P() [proberen, to test/probe]: atomic operation that waits for semaphore to become > 1, then decrements it by 1 (wait) 
- V() [verhogen, to increment]: an atomic operation that increments the semaphore by 1, waking up any P (signal). The initial semaphore value will determine how many threads can run in the critical section at once.

"- Most modern processors use Mesa-scheduling for task scheduling.
- The scheduler tries to accomplish several things:
  - Minimize response time.
  - Maximize throughput.
  - Ensure fairness.
- A drawback of context switching is CPU cache misses when a thread comes back from switching and finds that the CPU cache doesn't have the values it had before.
- The convoy effect refers to short processes getting stuck behind long processes in a FIFO-style ready queue.
- The round-robin scheduling scheme assigns each process a time quantum (q milliseconds) to run. Each process runs for that time slice (or until completion if close to done) and then goes back on the ready queue.
- Pros of the round-robin scheduling scheme include better handling of short jobs and fairness.
- A con of the round-robin scheduling scheme is that long jobs take longer due to the cumulative time spent on context switching.
- Context switching typically takes between 0.1ms to 1ms, resulting in roughly 1% overhead.

"- The scheduler changes a process' priority based on heuristics related to interactivity, locking, burst behavior, and more.
- Methods of avoiding deadlock include not allowing waiting for a resource (which leads to retries), having threads request all necessary resources at the beginning, enforcing a specific order for resource requests to prevent cyclic resource usage, and temporarily expanding resources when a deadlock is detected.
- The banker's algorithm is a deadlock prevention algorithm that dynamically allocates resources and evaluates each request, granting it only if some ordering of threads remains deadlock-free after the request. This is achieved by simulating the request as granted and checking for deadlocks.
- The banker's algorithm can solve the dining lawyers problem by ensuring that when trying to grab a chopstick, it is either not the last chopstick or it is the last chopstick but someone else will have two chopsticks afterward.
- The CPU uses virtual addresses.

[Front: What is an actor? Back: Briefly, actors are a lot like message queues without the configuration and message broker installation overhead. They’re like programmable message queues shrunk to microsize—you can easily create thousands, even millions of them. They don’t “do” anything unless they’re sent a message. Messages are simple data structures that can’t be changed after they’ve been created, or in a single word, they’re immutable. Actors can receive messages one at a time and execute some behavior whenever a message is received. Unlike queues, they can also send messages (to other actors). Everything an actor does is executed asynchronously. Simply put, you can send a message to an actor without waiting for a response. Actors aren’t like threads, but messages sent to them are pushed through on a thread at some point in time. How actors are connected to threads is configurable - this is not a hardwired relationship. For now the most important aspect of actors is that you build applications by sending and receiving messages. A message could be processed locally on some available thread, or remotely on another server. Exactly where the message is processed and where the actor lives are things you can decide later, which is very different compared to hardcoding threads and RPC style networking. Actors make it easy to build your application out of small parts that resemble networked services, only shrunk to microsize in footprint and administrative overhead.],

[Front: What is orthogonality? Back: In mathematical terms, it means being perpendicular.  Orthogonality in programming language design is the ability to use various language features in arbitrary combinations with consistent results.  Orthogonality is a system design property which guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system. Typically this is achieved through the separation of concerns and encapsulation, and it is essential for feasible and compact designs of complex systems. The emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration, i.e., non-orthogonal design of modules and interfaces. Orthogonality reduces testing and development time because it is easier to verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them.]"
"1. When dealing with scaling, how can you deal with rapidly increasing counters, like YouTube video views?
   - To deal with rapidly increasing counters like YouTube video views, adding randomness to a monotonic counter can be a solution. As long as people can see that the counter is increasing somewhat monotonically, it doesn't need to be 100% accurate. This approach avoids the need to lock the counter in a transaction.

2. What is exponential backoff and when is it used?
   - Exponential backoff, also known as truncated binary exponential backoff, is an algorithm used to space out repeated retransmissions of network or other service requests. It is often used as part of congestion avoidance when congestion is detected.

3. What data structure could be used to efficiently manage a leaderboard?
   - A b-tree can be used to efficiently manage a leaderboard. Each node in the b-tree manages a subset of the range of the worst to best scores.

4. What does adding jitter in system design help you avoid?
   - Adding jitter in system design helps avoid thundering herds, which occur when multiple requests or events synchronize and overwhelm the system. Jitter introduces more randomness, preventing things from stacking up and creating synchronization issues.

5. What is an example of adding jitter to a caching system?
   - An example of adding jitter to a caching system is by jittering cache expirations. Instead of all items expiring at the same time, a random expiration time within a range is used. This prevents requests from stacking up and causing synchronization issues.

6. What value can you make cron or other system intervals so they don't coincide?
   - Distinct prime numbers can be used as values for cron or other system intervals to avoid coinciding. This approach ensures that periodic tasks have unique intervals and reduces the chances of synchronization issues.","[Front: When dealing with scaling, how can you deal with rapidly increasing counters, like YouTube video views?

[Front: What is an example of adding jitter to a caching system? Back: Cache expirations. For a popular video they cache things as best they can. The most popular video they might cache for 24 hours. If everything expires at one time then every machine will calculate the expiration at the same time. This creates a thundering herd. By jittering you are saying randomly expire between 18-30 hours. That prevents things from stacking up. They use this all over the place. Systems have a tendency to self synchronize as operations line up and try to destroy themselves. Fascinating to watch. You get slow disk system on one machine and everybody is waiting on a request so all of a sudden all these other requests on all these other machines are completely synchronized. This happens when you have many machines and you have many events. Each one actually removes entropy from the system so you have to add some back in.],

"1. What Python package provides tools for adapting or extending functions and other callable objects, without completely rewriting them?
   - The functools package in Python provides tools for adapting or extending functions and other callable objects without the need for complete rewrites. It offers features like decorators, comparison, collation order, caching, and reducing a data set.

2. What is a proxy server?
   - A proxy server is an intermediate piece of hardware or software that receives requests from clients and relays them to the backend origin servers. Proxy servers are commonly used to filter requests, log requests, or transform requests by adding/removing headers, encrypting/decrypting, or compression.

3. What is collapsed forwarding?
   - Collapsed forwarding is a technique where a proxy server can combine or collapse the same or similar requests into one request and then return the single result to the requesting clients. This can help reduce unnecessary duplicate requests and improve efficiency.

4. What should be handling requests first, a proxy server or a cache?
   - In general, it is best to place the cache in front of the proxy server. The cache serves data from memory, making it fast and capable of handling multiple requests for the same result without incurring additional latency. Placing the cache behind the proxy would introduce additional latency for every request before reaching the cache, potentially hindering performance","[Front: What Python package provides tools for adapting or extending functions and other callable objects, without completely rewriting them?

This is because the cache is serving data from memory, it is very fast, and it doesn't mind multiple requests for the same result. But if the cache was located on the other side of the proxy server, then there would be additional latency with every request before the cache, and this could hinder performance.]"

  Back: In a synchronous system, there is no differentiation between request and reply, and they cannot be managed separately.

6. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): ISP advocates defining small interfaces based on groups of methods, allowing clients to implement only the interfaces they use. It avoids forcing clients to implement unnecessary methods.

7. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules directly. Both should depend on abstractions, and abstractions should not depend on details.

"- In testing, an oracle is a mechanism used by software testers and engineers to determine if a test has passed or failed. Oracles compare the output of the system under test, for a given test-case input, to the expected output determined by the oracle.

- When testing interfaces with a trust boundary, various inputs, including random inputs, are used to ensure that the system can handle them correctly without crashing.

- The Python flag `-O` turns on optimizations and removes assertions from the code. This can improve the execution speed but should be used when the code is production-ready and not during development or debugging.

- Performing substantial work in a constructor is discouraged as it can make the code harder to test. Constructors should generally focus on initializing object state rather than performing complex calculations or operations.

- To make testing easier and possible, certain practices should be avoided, including the use of static methods and properties, the final keyword, and the use of the `new` keyword in methods (instead, dependency injection should be utilized).

- A setter is also known as a mutator, as it modifies the value of an attribute or property of an object.

- A getter is also known as an accessor, as it retrieves the value of an attribute or property of an object.

- To avoid violating the dependency inversion principle, some guidelines can be followed. These include avoiding variables with concrete class types and preferring abstract types instead.

"1. What is stored in a TCB?
    - Registers, program counter, stack counter
    - The TCB (Thread control block) is a data structure used by the operating system to store information about a thread. It includes the thread's registers, program counter, and stack counter.

2. What is separate chaining?
    - In hash table conflict resolution, each bucket is independent and has some sort of linked list of entries with the same index. The time for hash table operations is the time to find the bucket (which is constant) plus the time for the list operation. In a good hash table, each bucket has zero or one entries, and sometimes two or three, but rarely more than that. Therefore, structures that are efficient in time and space for these cases are preferred. Structures that are efficient for a fairly large number of entries per bucket are not needed or desirable. If these cases happen often, the hashing function needs to be fixed.
    - Separate chaining is a method used to handle collisions in hash tables. It involves creating a linked list of entries for each bucket in the hash table, where each entry with the same index is stored in a separate chain.

3. What is open addressing?
    - In hash table conflict resolution, all entry records are stored in the bucket array itself. When a new entry has to be inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the hashed-to slot and proceeding in some probe sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found. When searching for an entry, the buckets are scanned in the same sequence, until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates that there is no such key in the table. The name ""open addressing"" refers to the fact that the location (""address"") of the item is not determined by its hash value. (This method is also called closed hashing; it should not be confused with ""open hashing"" or ""closed addressing"" that usually mean separate chaining.)
    - Open addressing is another method used to handle collisions in hash tables. It involves storing all the entries in slots within the bucket array itself, rather than using separate chains. If a collision occurs, the algorithm probes through the array to find the next available slot.

4. What is the length of the longest chain in a hash table using separate chaining?
    - O(1 + alpha) where alpha is the load factor, n/m.
    - The length of the longest chain in a hash table using separate chaining is proportional to the load factor (n/m), where n is the number of entries and m is the number of buckets. As the load factor increases, the length of the chains also increases, impacting the performance of the hash table.

5. Since uniform hashing is difficult to achieve in practice, what is a great alternative?
    - Double hashing
    - Double hashing is an alternative method to achieve better hash table performance when uniform hashing is difficult. It involves using a secondary hash function to resolve collisions by probing through the hash table.

6. How can you test if a number is odd in bitwise operations?
    - return (x & 1)
    - To test if a number is odd using bitwise operations, you can perform a bitwise AND operation between the number and 1. If the result is non-zero, the number is odd.

7. How can you test if a number is even in bitwise operations?
    - return (x & 1) == 0
    - To test if a number is even using bitwise operations, you can perform a bitwise AND operation between the number and 1, and then compare the result to 0. If the result is zero, the number is even.","[Front: What is stored in a TCB? Back: registers program counter stack counter],

"1. How can you optimize finding a pivot when the segment to pivot is large (not random choice)?
- Choose a median of three.

2. What is counting sort?
- Counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values.

3. What is radix sort?
- Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value. Two classifications of radix sorts are least significant digit (LSD) radix sorts and most significant digit (MSD) radix sorts.

4. What is the counting sort running time?
- The running time of counting sort is O(q + n) where q is the number of unique items. If q is in O(n), then it has a linear time complexity.

5. What radix is most natural to use?
- A power of 2 radix is most natural to use.

6. How would radix sort work for IEEE floating point numbers?
- For IEEE floating point numbers, you need to flip all bits for negative numbers, then perform the sort, and finally, flip the bits back.

7. How to choose q for radix sort?
- Choose q within a power of 2 of n. This ensures that the number of passes is small. The best rule is to round n down to the next power of 2. Alternatively, you can round sqrt(n) down to the next power of 2, but this will require twice as many passes.

3. What is Kruskal's algorithm?
   - Answer: Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm that finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph by adding increasing cost arcs at each step. This means it finds a subset of the edges that form a tree including every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. If the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest (a minimum spanning tree for each connected component).

[Front: What is Kruskal's algorithm? Back: Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph adding increasing cost arcs at each step. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. If the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest (a minimum spanning tree for each connected component).],

"1. What are the 2 algorithms for convex hull? 
   - Answer: The two algorithms for convex hull are Graham scan and Jarvis march (gift-wrapping method).

2. How does a Graham scan work in finding convex hull? 
   - Answer: A Graham scan finds convex hull at O(n log n) time complexity. It starts by sorting the points and then performs a simple single pass through all the points, making only left turns as it goes around the perimeter counter-clockwise. When the next point is a right turn, it backtracks past all points using a stack and popping points off until that turn becomes a left turn.

3. How does the Jarvis march work in finding convex hull? 
   - Answer: The Jarvis march finds convex hull starting with the leftmost point, denoted as p. It goes through each point to the right of p and, using p as a pivot, finds which point is the most clockwise. This process continues until the starting point is reached, creating the convex hull. The time complexity of Jarvis march is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n refers to the number of input points.

4. What is the worst case time complexity of a Jarvis march? 
   - Answer: The worst case time complexity of a Jarvis march is O(n^2). This occurs when most points are part of the hull and few points are contained within the hull.

5. What is the average complexity of a Jarvis march? 
   - Answer: The average complexity of a Jarvis march is O(n * h), where n is the number of input points and h is the number of points that compose the hull.

6. What is white-box testing? 
   - Answer: White-box testing refers to a testing approach where the tester has knowledge of the program's internals. This includes understanding the code, data structures, and algorithms used.

7. What is black-box testing? 
   - Answer: Black-box testing refers to a testing approach where the tester tests the program without knowledge of its internals. The focus is solely on input-output behavior and functionality.

8. What is unit testing? 
   - Answer: Unit testing is the process of testing a single module or component of a program in isolation. It helps ensure that the individual units of code perform correctly.

9. What factors can affect testing, apart from API inputs? 
   - Answer: Apart from API inputs, factors that can affect testing include timing of inputs, disk full scenarios, network latency, and network failures.

10. In what situations is the timing of inputs important in testing? 
    - Answer: The timing of inputs is important in testing when the System Under Test (SUT) interacts directly with hardware devices, interfaces with other machines on the network, or when the SUT is multithreaded.

- Finding an element in a balanced binary search tree has a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the number of elements in the tree. This is because the tree is structured in a way that ensures efficient search by dividing the search space in half with each comparison.
- Adding an element to a balanced binary search tree also has a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the number of elements in the tree. This is because adding an element may require rebalancing the tree to maintain its balanced property.
- Deleting an element from a balanced binary search tree also has a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the number of elements in the tree. This is because deleting an element may require rebalancing the tree after the removal.

"1. Insert (binary heap):
   - Time Complexity: O(log N)
   - Explanation: When inserting an element into a binary heap, it is placed at the next available position in the array representation of the complete heap-ordered binary tree. Then, it is ""bubbled up"" by comparing it with its parent and swapping positions if necessary. This process continues until the heap property is restored.
   
2. RemoveMin (binary heap):
   - Time Complexity: O(log N)
   - Explanation: Removing the minimum element from a binary heap involves swapping it with the last element in the heap and then ""bubbling down"" that element to its correct position. This is done by comparing it with its children and swapping positions if necessary. The process continues until the heap property is restored.
   
3. Build (binary heap):
   - Time Complexity: O(N)
   - Explanation: Building a binary heap from an arbitrary array involves inserting each element into the heap one by one using the insert operation. Since the insert operation takes O(log N) time, when performed on all elements, the total time complexity becomes O(N log N). However, using a bottom-up approach, we can reduce the time complexity to O(N). The array is seen as a complete binary tree, and elements from the second half of the array (ignoring leaves) are ""bubbled down"" individually to their correct positions. This process is repeated for all parent nodes until the heap property is restored.

4. What is a binary heap?
   - Explanation: A binary heap is a collection of keys arranged in a complete heap-ordered binary tree, represented in level order in an array (not using the first entry). The parent of the node in position k is in position [k/2], and the two children of the node in position k are in positions 2k and 2k+1. The heap property states that for a min-heap, the key of every parent node is less than or equal to the key of its children nodes.

5. What is an Adaptable Priority Queue?
   - Explanation: An adaptable priority queue is a priority queue that allows you to change the priority of objects already in the queue. In addition to the standard operations found in a priority queue (e.g., insert, removeMin), an adaptable priority queue provides methods to update the priority of a specific element in the queue.

6. What is the time complexity of quicksort?
   - Time Complexity: O(N^2) worst case, O(N log N) best case and expected case.
   - Explanation: Quicksort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. In the worst case, it may require O(N^2) comparisons and swaps, which occurs when the pivot selection is not optimal (e.g., selecting the smallest or largest element as the pivot). However, with a good choice of pivot (e.g., median of the array), quicksort exhibits a time complexity of O(N log N) in the best case and expected case, making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms.","[Front: insert (binary heap) Back: O(log N)],

"1. Lower Bound for Comparison Based Sorting:
   - Explanation: No comparison-based sorting algorithm can be faster than O(N log N). This lower bound result was proven, showing that the number of comparisons required by any comparison-based sorting algorithm to sort a list of N elements is at least proportional to N log N.

2. k-th smallest (full heap):
   - Time Complexity: O(N + k log N)
   - Explanation: To find the k-th smallest element in a collection of values using a full heap, all values are inserted into the heap, and then the removeMin operation is performed k times. Since inserting N elements into the heap takes O(N) time, and each removeMin operation takes O(log N) time, the overall time complexity is O(N + k log N).","[Front: Lower Bound for Comparison Based Sorting Back: No comparison based sorting algorithm can be faster than O(N log N)],

   - Explanation: A connected graph is a graph in which there exists a path from every vertex to every other vertex. In other words, for any two vertices in a connected graph, there is at least one path that connects them.

2. What is a tree?
   - Explanation: A tree is an acyclic connected graph. It is a special type of graph where there are no cycles, and each pair of vertices is connected by a unique path. In a tree, there is a unique path between any two vertices, and every vertex, except the root (if defined), has exactly one parent.

3. What is a cycle?
   - Explanation: A cycle in a graph refers to a path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same. In other words, starting from a vertex and following a sequence of edges, if one can return to the same vertex without traversing any previously visited edges (except the incident edge to the starting vertex), then a cycle exists in the graph","[Front: What is a connected graph?

External sorting is required when the data being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a computing device (usually RAM) and instead they must reside in the slower external memory (usually a hard drive). External sorting typically uses a hybrid sort-merge strategy. In the sorting phase, chunks of data small enough to fit in main memory are read, sorted, and written out to a temporary file.

This is done by using the logarithms of the edge weights, which allows for the computation of the minimum product spanning tree on the original graph. It is used to minimize the product of edge weights.
- Rolling hash: A rolling hash is a hash function that operates on a sliding window of input data. It is used in various algorithms, such as the Rabin-Karp string search algorithm.

The algorithm repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number and replaces the larger number with the remainder. It continues until the remainder is zero, and the GCD is found to be the last non-zero remainder.
- Rabin-Karp algorithm: The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string search algorithm that uses rolling hash codes to efficiently search for a pattern in a text. It computes hash codes for substrings of the text and compares them with the hash code of the pattern. If the hash codes match, the algorithm performs additional checks to confirm the match.
