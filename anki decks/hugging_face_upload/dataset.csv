[Front: How can build heap be done in linear time? Back: A tree of size n nodes, will have floor(n/2^h) nodes with height >= h. The last half of nodes will be leaves, so they already satisfy the heap property. No work needs to be done on them. going bottom-up (ignoring the last n/2 items) and satisfying the heap property one level at a time, each level going up the tree has to do at most 1 operation more than the level below it. But as you go up the tree, higher levels have fewer nodes, so you may be doing more operations, but it happens on fewer number of times. This resembles a series:  n/2 - height 1: 1 operations n/4 - height 2: 2 operation n/8 - height 3: 3 operations ... going to floor(n/2^h) - height h: h operations  n * (1/2 + 2/4 + 3/8 + 4/16 ....) = n * 1 = n],

Back: The van Emde Boas tree supports insertions, deletions, lookups, successor queries, and predecessor queries in time O(log log U), where U is the universe of items to store. Items are stored in clusters of size sqrt(U).   The van Emde Boas data structure divides the range {0,...,n−1} into blocks of size sqrt(n), which we call clusters. Each cluster is itself a vEB structure of size sqrt(n). In addition, there is a “summary” structure that keeps track of which clusters are nonempty.  More detail: A van Emde Boas tree (or van Emde Boas priority queue), also known as a vEB tree, is a tree data structure which implements an associative array with m-bit integer keys. It performs all operations in O(log m) time, or equivalently in O(log log M) time, where M = 2m is the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the tree. The M is not to be confused with the actual number of elements stored in the tree, by which the performance of other tree data-structures is often measured. The vEB tree has good space efficiency when it contains a large number of elements, as discussed below. It was invented by a team led by Dutch computer scientist Peter van Emde Boas in 1975.],

"Chapter Title: Graph Representations and Their Trade-offs

Chapter Summary:
This chapter explores the different representations of graphs, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of using an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list. It explains the best and worst-case running times of binary search, as well as the downsides of using an adjacency matrix and when using an adjacency list becomes expensive. Additionally, it discusses the scenarios in which adjacency lists are most useful and how they can be optimized for other operations.

Section 1: Binary Search
- Best-case running time of binary search: O(1) - finding the element right at the midpoint.
- Worst-case running time of binary search: O(log n)

Section 2: Using an Adjacency Matrix
- Downsides of using an adjacency matrix: Finding all the outgoing edges from a vertex takes O(n) time, even if there aren't many edges. The space cost is O(n^2), making it inefficient for sparse graphs.

Section 3: Using an Adjacency List
- When using an adjacency list becomes expensive: Finding predecessors of a node u is extremely expensive, taking O(n + e) time, where e is the total number of edges. Storing a second copy of the graph with reversed edges can solve this issue.
- When adjacency lists are most useful: Adjacency lists are most useful when the main focus is to enumerate outgoing edges of each node. They are commonly used in search tasks to find paths or compute distances between nodes. Augmenting the adjacency list representation with sorted arrays or reversed edges can optimize other operations.","[Front: What's the best-case running time of binary search?

Back: Finding predecessors of a node u is extremely expensive, requiring looking through every list of every node in time O(n + e), where e is the total number of edges, although if this is something we actually need to do often we can store a second copy of the graph with the edges reversed.],
[Front: When are adjacency lists most useful? Back: Adjacency lists are most useful when we mostly want to enumerate outgoing edges of each node. This is common in search tasks, where we want to find a path from one node to another or compute the distances between pairs of nodes. If other operations are important, we can optimize them by augmenting the adjacency list representation; for example, using sorted arrays for the adjacency lists reduces the cost of edge existence testing to O(log(d+ (u))), and adding a second copy of the graph with reversed edges lets us find all predecessors of u in O(d− (u)) time, where d− (u) is u's in-degree.]"

"Dynamic Programming: Feasibility
Feasibility refers to the rules and constraints that an algorithm must adhere to in order to reach its solution. In the context of dynamic programming, feasibility plays a crucial role in determining the validity and correctness of the algorithm. By defining the feasibility conditions, we establish the boundaries within which the algorithm operates. These conditions can include limitations on the problem's input, constraints on the solution space, and any other rules that must be followed during the computation process. Understanding feasibility is essential for designing and implementing effective dynamic programming solutions.","[Front: When talking dynamic programming, what is feasibility? Back: The rules the algorithm must adhere to in reaching its solution.]"
"Dynamic Programming: Optimality
Optimality is a key characteristic of dynamic programming algorithms. An algorithm is said to have optimality if the subsolutions of an optimal solution for the problem are themselves optimal solutions to their respective subproblems. This property enables dynamic programming algorithms to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems. By breaking down a complex problem into smaller subproblems and leveraging the optimality of their solutions, dynamic programming algorithms can gradually build up the optimal solution for the original problem. This iterative approach, combined with the concept of optimality, forms the foundation of dynamic programming's efficiency and effectiveness.

Dynamic Programming: Introduction
Dynamic programming is a versatile algorithmic technique used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Combinatorial optimization problems involve finding the best input for a function selected from a potentially exponentially large search space. The dynamic programming approach consists of two essential components. First, it is a programming technique that involves dividing and conquering the problem by recursively solving smaller instances. However, unlike traditional divide and conquer algorithms, dynamic programming solves the smaller instances from the bottom up, storing the results in a table. Second, dynamic programming is a design principle that focuses on preserving alternative solutions and delaying commitment to specific choices whenever possible. This principle ensures that all potential solutions are considered and allows for more efficient computation by reducing duplicate subproblem calculations. By combining these two aspects, dynamic programming provides an efficient solution to complex combinatorial optimization problems.

Dynamic Programming: Naive Recursive Fibonacci Complexity
The complexity of a naive recursive Fibonacci function is given by Θ(φ^n), where φ (phi) represents the golden ratio, approximately equal to (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 or 1.618. In this context, the Θ notation represents the tight bounds of the function's complexity. The exponential nature of the Fibonacci sequence, coupled with the recursive computation, leads to an exponential time complexity. As the input size (n) increases, the number of recursive function calls grows exponentially, resulting in significant performance degradation. Therefore, for larger values of n, the naive recursive approach becomes impractical and inefficient. This highlights the need for more efficient techniques like dynamic programming to solve Fibonacci and similar problems.","[Front: When talking dynamic programming, what is optimality? Back: An algorithm has optimality if the subsolutions of an optimal solution of the problem are themsleves optimal solutions for their subproblems.],
[Front: What is dynamic programming? Back: Dynamic programming is a general-purpose algorithm design technique that is most often used to solve combinatorial optimization problems, where we are looking for the best possible input to some function chosen from an exponentially large search space.  There are two parts to dynamic programming. The first part is a programming technique: dynamic programming is essentially divide and conquer run in reverse: we solve a big instance of a problem by breaking it up recursively into smaller instances; but instead of carrying out the computation recursively from the top down, we start from the bottom with the smallest instances of the problem, solving each increasingly large instance in turn and storing the result in a table. The second part is a design principle: in building up our table, we are careful always to preserve alternative solutions we may need later, by delaying commitment to particular choices to the extent that we can.  The bottom-up aspect of dynamic programming is most useful when a straightforward recursion would produce many duplicate subproblems. It is most efficient when we can enumerate a class of subproblems that doesn't include too many extraneous cases that we don't need for our original problem.],
[Front: What is the complexity for a naive recursive Fibonacci function? Back: Θ(φ^n), where phi(φ) is the golden ratio (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.  approx: 1.618]"
"Dynamic Programming: Fibonacci (Dynamic Programming Version)
The dynamic programming version of computing the Fibonacci sequence for a given value of n involves utilizing a table to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations. By starting with the base cases of fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1, we iteratively compute the Fibonacci sequence up to fib(n) by summing the previous two values. The approach follows a bottom-up strategy, calculating each Fibonacci number in sequence and storing it in the fibValues table. By leveraging previously computed values, this dynamic programming implementation efficiently avoids redundant calculations and improves overall performance. The resulting code snippet for computing the Fibonacci sequence utilizing dynamic programming is as follows:

def fib(n):
    fibValues = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fibValues.append(fibValues[i - 1] + fibValues[i - 2])
    return fibValues[n]

Dynamic Programming: Longest Common Subsequence (Dynamic Programming Implementation)
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem that involves finding the longest subsequence shared by two input sequences. A dynamic programming approach can effectively solve this problem by using a table to store intermediate results. The table, denoted as T, has dimensions (rows × columns), where rows represent the elements of the first sequence, and columns represent the elements of the second sequence. Each cell in the table T corresponds to the length of the LCS considering the elements up to that point. By iteratively filling the table based on specific conditions, the algorithm identifies the maximum length of the common subsequence. The following code snippet demonstrates a dynamic programming implementation for finding the longest common subsequence of two strings:

def longest_common_subsequence(sequence1, sequence2):
    cols = len(sequence1) + 1
    rows = len(sequence2) + 1
    T = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(1, rows):
        for j in range(1, cols):
            if sequence2[i - 1] == sequence1[j - 1]:

Object-Oriented Programming: Difference between __str__ and __repr__
In object-oriented programming, the __str__ and __repr__ methods serve different purposes. The __str__ method is intended to provide a human-readable representation of an object. It returns a string that represents the object's state or content in a way that is understandable to humans. This method is often used for debugging or displaying object information to users.

On the other hand, the __repr__ method's primary purpose is to provide an unambiguous representation of an object. It is typically used to reconstruct the object using the string returned by __repr__ as an input to the object's constructor. By convention, the __repr__ method should return a string that follows a specific format representing the object's internal state. For example, in a Vector class, the __repr__ method could return a string like ""Vector(x_value, y_value)"" or ""Vector(x_value, y_value)"" % (self.x, self.y). This representation aims to be precise and concise, facilitating object reconstruction if needed.

Furthermore, when a container is involved, calling __str__ on the container will utilize the __repr__ method of its elements to obtain their string representations. This ensures that the container's string representation contains the unambiguous representations of its contained elements","[Front: Write a dynamic programming version of computing Fibonacci for n.

There are 3 age stages where objects live in memory. They all start in the ""nursery"", stage0, then if they survive a garbage collection, they are moved to stage1, the oldest objects that continue to survive in stage1 are promoted to stage2. The gc module has thresholds 700, 10, 10 for each stage. In order to decide when to run, the collector keeps track of the number object allocations and deallocations since the last collection. When the number of allocations minus the number of deallocations exceeds threshold0, collection starts. If generation 0 has been examined more than threshold1 times since generation 1 has been examined, then generation 1 is examined as well. Similarly, threshold2 controls the number of collections of generation 1 before collecting generation 2.]"

Please note that these are only tentative chapter titles, and the content can be expanded and organized further based on the required textbook structure and depth of explanation","[Front: How is garbage collection done in PyPy? Back: The GC implementation can be chosen at runtime. It's pluggable. PyPy uses mark and sweep, and generational gc optimization. Marked objects are promoted from the nursery to an older generation. PyPy uses incremental garbage collection, where major collection is split into multiple passes, each lasting only a few milliseconds.],
[Front: How does mark and sweep work? Back: (In Java) Perform a DFS on the graph of references to objects. This graph can have multiple roots. Each root is a reference that the program can access directly, such as a variable. Traverse the graph, setting a mark bit in each object. The sweep phase causes unmarked memory to be linked together in a list, so that memory can be reallocated. Sometimes this also triggers compaction, which moves used objects adjacent to each other in memory. The side effect of this is that free memory is also adjacent to free memory so large blocks can be allocated.],
[Front: What is copying garbage collection (stop and copy)? Back: Heap memory is split into 2 partitions: an old space and a new space. Find live objects by DFS of their reference graph, and move live objects into the new space. The new space is now called the old space. Unreachable objects are simply left in the old space to be overwritten the next time collection occurs. The movement of objects implicitly compacts the objects. Disadvantage: you can only use half of the heap space.],
[Front: How could you implement an LRU cache? Back: A fast lookup table, like a hash table or binary tree, and a linked list of items by use. When you access or add an item, you delete it from the linked list and add it to the head of the list.  Then to prune, traverse the linked list and remove trailing elements, and delete them from the storage (tree or hash table). You can also use a splay tree, since it moves accesses to the root. To prune items, somehow find and remove the leaves, since the number of leaves will be about n/2.],
[Front: What is a direct mapped cache? Back: It's a type of cache used in the CPU, where the lower order bits of a given memory address are used modulo the number of cache lines to place or lookup in the cache. Collisions are treated as overwrites.],
[Front: What is a fully-associative cache? Back: It's a type of cache used in the CPU, where lookups are done on all cache lines in parallel to determine a hit or miss.  This requires a very large number of comparators that increase the complexity and cost of implementing large caches. Therefore, this type of cache is usually only used for small caches, typically less than 4K.],
[Front: Disadvantage of a fully-associative cache? Back: - expensive due to parallel checks - complexity of implementing this scheme],
[Front: How do some processors handle caching for data and instructions? Back: There will be a slightly slower (3-4 clocks latency) separate cache for data.],
[Front: What is an N-way set associative cache? Back: A Set-Associative cache scheme is a combination of Fully-Associative and Direct Mapped caching schemes. A set-associate scheme works by dividing the cache SRAM into equal sections (2 or 4 sections typically) called cache ways. The cache page size is equal to the size of the cache way. Each cache way is treated like a small direct mapped cache.]"
"Chapter 1: Memory Hierarchy of a Core i7 Processor
----------------------------------------------
Inside of each core in a Core i7 processor lies a memory hierarchy that consists of different levels of cache. At the first level, there is a 32 kB L1 instruction cache and a 32 kB L1 data cache, both of which are 8-way set associative. These caches provide fast access to frequently used instructions and data. 

Moving up the hierarchy, there is a dedicated 256 kB L2 cache, which is also 8-way set associative. This cache is larger than the L1 caches and provides a slightly slower but still quick access to instructions and data.

Finally, outside of the cores, there is a larger cache called the L3 cache. The L3 cache in a Core i7 processor is much larger, with a capacity of 8 MB, and exhibits a smarter behavior, being 16-way associative. The L3 cache serves as a shared cache for all the cores in the processor, providing a larger storage space and more efficient caching capabilities.

Understanding the memory hierarchy of a Core i7 processor is crucial for optimizing performance and improving overall system efficiency. By effectively utilizing the different levels of cache, developers can reduce memory access latency and enhance program execution speed.

Chapter 2: Entropy and Predictability
-------------------------------------
Entropy is a fundamental concept in information theory that measures the uncertainty or randomness of a given set of outcomes. It represents the minimum number of bits needed to represent a certain number of states. When all outcomes are equal, the entropy is at its maximum, implying the highest level of uncertainty.

As predictability increases, the entropy decreases. This means that when the outcomes of a system become more predictable, the amount of uncertainty or randomness decreases. Conversely, when there is less predictability, the entropy increases, indicating a higher degree of uncertainty or randomness.

Understanding the relationship between entropy and predictability is important in various domains, such as data compression and cryptography. It allows us to analyze and quantify the level of uncertainty in a system, enabling us to make informed decisions and design efficient algorithms.","[Front: Describe the memory hierarchy of a Core i7 processor. Back: Inside of each core is a 32 kB L1 instruction cache, a 32 kB L1 data cache (it's 8-way set associative), and a dedicated 256 kB L2 cache (also 8-way set associative).  Outside of the cores is the L3, which is much larger at 8 MB and smarter (16-way associative) than the L2s.],
[Front: When is entropy at its maximum? Back: When all outcomes are equal.],
[Front: As predictability increases, what happens to entropy? Back: It decreases.]"
"Chapter 1: Entropy and Compression
---------------------------------
Entropy plays a crucial role in data compression. In the context of compression, entropy is the measure of uncertainty or randomness in a given dataset. As entropy increases, our ability to compress the data decreases.

Low entropy means that the data is highly predictable, as there is less uncertainty or randomness. Predictable data can be compressed more efficiently since the patterns and redundancies can be exploited to reduce the amount of information needed to represent the data accurately.

However, as entropy increases, the data becomes less predictable and more random, resulting in fewer compressible patterns or redundancies. Hence, our ability to compress the data decreases, as there is a higher minimum number of bits required to represent the states accurately.

Chapter 2: Cryptography - Ciphers and Entropy
----------------------------------------------
Ciphers play a crucial role in ensuring secure communication by encrypting messages using specific algorithms. Two common types of ciphers are the Caesar cipher and the polyalphabetic cipher.

In a Caesar cipher, the alphabet is shifted or rotated by a specific number agreed upon beforehand. This simple substitution cipher replaces each letter with another letter a fixed distance down the alphabet. The degree of shifting determines the security of the cipher, and it relies on low entropy for its effectiveness.

A polyalphabetic cipher, on the other hand, uses a keyword to determine the shifting of letters instead of a fixed shift. It applies a series of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of the keyword, creating a more complex encryption algorithm that is harder to break.

Both ciphers rely on the concept of entropy, where entropy determines the minimum number of bits needed to represent a certain number of states. Understanding the relationship between entropy and ciphers is crucial for designing and implementing secure encryption algorithms.

Chapter 3: Idempotency and REST
------------------------------
In the context of HTTP methods used in RESTful web services, idempotency is an essential property. Idempotent methods are those that produce the same result regardless of how many times they are executed.

According to the REST specification, the GET and PUT methods are considered idempotent. The GET method retrieves a resource, and even if the request is made multiple times, the result should be the same. Similarly, the PUT method updates a resource, and repeating the operation should yield the same outcome.

However, the POST method, commonly used for creating new resources, is not idempotent. Multiple POST requests can lead to the creation of multiple resources or different outcomes.

Interestingly, the DELETE method is also considered idempotent according to the REST specification. However, achieving idempotency for the DELETE operation depends on the developer's implementation. One way to achieve idempotency for DELETE is by using a deleted flag for a resource instead of completely removing it from the system.

Understanding the concept of idempotency in the context of RESTful web services is crucial for building robust and reliable systems.","[Front: As it relates to compression, as entropy increases, does our ability to compress increase? Back: No, it decreases.],

"Chapter 1: Idempotence and Request Handling
-------------------------------------------
Idempotence is a property that is applicable to methods used in various request handling scenarios. It refers to the property where making more than one identical requests yields the same outcome as a single request.

This property is particularly important in situations where request execution has side effects or performs actions that should not be repeated or duplicated. By ensuring that certain methods are idempotent, developers can guarantee consistent behavior when handling multiple requests.

Chapter 2: Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) and Message Authentication Code (MAC)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code) and MAC (Message Authentication Code) are cryptographic techniques used to provide a checksum for a message, enhancing the confidence that the message has not been tampered with during transmission.

HMAC is a specific implementation of MAC that utilizes a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key. It produces a unique output that can only be reproduced if the message and the secret key match, ensuring both integrity and authenticity.

MAC, on the other hand, is a general term for a class of algorithms that generate a checksum using a cryptographic key. It provides similar security guarantees as HMAC but may use different techniques and algorithms.

Understanding HMAC and MAC is essential in ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications to messages during transmission.

Chapter 3: RSA Cryptography and Phi Function
--------------------------------------------
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptography method. It involves the generation of a public-private key pair, where the public key can be freely distributed, and the private key is kept secret.

With RSA, the public key is used to encrypt a message into ciphertext, which can only be decrypted by the owner of the private key. The private key is used to encrypt messages, and the public key is used for decryption of messages encrypted with the corresponding private key.

The phi function is an important concept in RSA cryptography. It determines the number of integers less than or equal to a given number that do not share a common factor with that number. For prime numbers, the phi function equals n - 1, where n is the prime number itself.

Additionally, RSA relies on the concept of the greatest common divisor (gcd), which determines the largest positive integer that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder. When a prime number is involved, the gcd with any other number (except in the case of pseudoprimes) is always 1.

Chapter 4: Secure Hashing Algorithms (SHA)
-----------------------------------------
Secure Hashing Algorithms (SHA) are a family of cryptographic hash functions that generate a fixed-size output (hash) from an arbitrary-sized input data. The output hash is unique to the input data, making it tamper-proof and computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the input from the hash.

SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm, and there are several standardized iterations, such as SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. Each iteration has different output sizes and security levels.

SHA-3, the latest addition to the SHA family, has a maximum output size of 512 bits. It provides improved security and resistance against certain attacks compared to its predecessors, making it suitable for various cryptographic applications.

Understanding the concepts and applications of secure hashing algorithms, particularly SHA, is crucial for protecting data integrity and ensuring secure communication in various domains","[Front: What is idempotent?

[Front: How does LZ77-based compression work? Back: LZ77 is a dictionary encoding algorithm, which is a statistical encoding algorithm. Compression in the LZ77 algorithm is based on the notion that strings of characters (words, phrases, etc.) occur repeatedly in the message being compressed.  The input is partitioned into 2 segments: a search buffer and a look-ahead buffer. The search buffer maxes out at 32KB. Starting with one character in the LA buffer, it looks back in the search buffer to find a copy of the symbol. If one is found, it looks at the second symbol of the LA buffer to see if it also matches the predecessor. Using this method, it can detect long phrases of symbols and encode them as one unit.  This process implicitly creates a rolling statistical probability for each symbol/phrase.],
[Front: What is Huffman encoding? Back: Huffman encoding algorithm analyzes the occurrence of individual symbols and creates a binary tree where the common symbols are closest to the root, using fewer bits to encode, and less common/rare symbols have longer paths on the tree, with longer encodings to accommodate.

"Chapter 1: Concurrency and Synchronization

1.1 Priority Inversion Problem
- Definition: The priority inversion problem occurs when a thread that is busy-waiting for a lock to be released ends up stealing CPU and getting a higher priority than the thread with the lock. Consequently, the waiting thread gets higher priority, preventing the thread holding the lock from completing and releasing it.

1.2 Busy-Waiting
- Definition: Busy-waiting refers to one or more threads using a significant amount of CPU by continuously checking a value or using test&set() operation to check and write a value while waiting for a lock to be released. This behavior results in CPU being stolen from the thread holding the lock.

1.3 Semaphores
- Definition: Semaphores, as defined by Dijkstra, are signaling solutions for handling concurrency data integrity problems in multi-threaded applications. A semaphore is a non-negative integer that supports two operations: P() (proberen, to test/probe) and V() (verhogen, to increment). P() is an atomic operation that waits for the semaphore to become greater than 0 and then decrements it by 1, while V() is an atomic operation that increments the semaphore by 1 and wakes up any threads waiting for P(). The initial value of the semaphore determines the number of threads allowed to run in the critical section concurrently.

1.4 Mutual Exclusion
- Definition: Mutual exclusion refers to the concept of allowing only one thread to access a critical section at a time. In the context of semaphores, a binary semaphore serves as a mutual exclusion mechanism.

1.5 Monitors
- Definition: A monitor is a programming construct that consists of a lock and zero or more condition variables for managing concurrent access to shared data. It ensures that only one thread can enter the monitor at a time and provides mechanisms for thread synchronization and communication.

1.6 Using Locks and Condition Variables
- Locks: Locks are primarily used for achieving mutual exclusion, allowing only one thread to access a critical section at a time.
- Condition Variables: Condition variables are used for managing scheduling constraints, allowing threads to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding within a critical section.","[Front: What is the priority inversion problem? Back: A thread that is busy-waiting for a lock to be released ends up stealing CPU and getting a higher priority than the thread with the lock. SO since the waiting thread gets higher priority, the thread holding the lock can't complete and release the lock.],
[Front: What is busy-waiting? Back: One or more threads is using a lot of CPU by continuously checking a value, or test&set() checking and writing a value in wiating for a lock to release, thus stealing CPU from the thread holding the lock.],
[Front: What is a semaphore? Back: A semaphore (defined by Dijkstra) is kind of signaling solution for handling concurrency data integrity problems that arise in multi-threaded applications. It has a non-negative integer that supports 2 operations: - P() [proberen, to test/probe] - atomic operation that waits for semaphore to become > 1, then decrements it by 1 (wait) - V() [verhogen, to increment] - an atomic operation that increments the semaphore by 1, waking up any P (signal)  The initial semaphore value will determine how many threads can run in the critical section at once.],

[Front: What should locks and condition variables each be used for? Back: locks - mutual exclusion condition variables - scheduling constraints],
[Front: What is a condition variable? Back: A queue of threads waiting for access to something in a critical section.]"
"Chapter 2: Scheduling and Context Switching

2.1 Condition Variables and Sleeping
- Special Feature of Condition Variables: Condition variables allow sleeping inside a critical section by atomically releasing the lock when the thread goes to sleep. This feature helps in avoiding unnecessary resource consumption by threads that are waiting for a certain condition.

2.2 Methods on Condition Variables
- Wait(&lock): A method that causes the calling thread to wait until another thread signals or broadcasts on the associated condition variable.
- Signal(): A method that signals the next waiting thread, allowing it to proceed.
- Broadcast(): A method that signals all waiting threads, allowing them to proceed.

2.3 Scheduling in Modern Processors
- Mesa-Scheduling: Most modern processors utilize Mesa-scheduling, which aims to achieve minimal response time, maximize throughput, and provide fairness among processes.

2.4 Scheduler Objectives
- Response Time: The scheduler attempts to minimize the time taken for a process to start executing in response to an event.
- Throughput: The scheduler aims to maximize the number of processes completed per unit of time.
- Fairness: The scheduler strives to allocate resources fairly among competing processes.

2.5 Context Switching
- Drawback of Context Switching: Context switching involves the process of saving the state of a thread and restoring the state of another thread. However, it can lead to CPU cache misses when a thread returns from switching and finds that the CPU cache does not contain the values it had before, resulting in performance degradation.

2.6 Convoy Effect
- Definition: The convoy effect occurs when short processes get stuck behind long processes in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) style ready queue. This effect can lead to inefficiencies in utilizing CPU resources.

2.7 Round Robin Scheduling Scheme
- Definition: The round-robin scheduling scheme assigns each process a time quantum (q milliseconds) to run. Typically, the time quantum ranges from 10 to 100 milliseconds, and it can be adjusted. Each process runs for the assigned time slice (or until completion if close to done) and then goes back on the ready queue.","[Front: What is a special feature of condition variables? Back: It allows sleeping inside a critical section by atomically releasing lock at the time we sleep.],

[Front: What's the convoy effect? Back: Short processes get stuck behind long processes in a FIFO style ready queue.],
[Front: What is the round robin scheduling scheme? Back: Each process gets a time quantum q milliseconds to run. 10-100ms, the q is tunable. Each process runs for that time slice (or until completion if close to done) and then goes back on the ready queue.]"
"Chapter 3: Advantages and Disadvantages of Scheduling Schemes

3.1 Pros of Round Robin Scheduling Scheme
- Improved for Short Jobs: The round-robin scheduling scheme is better suited for short jobs (i.e., jobs that fit within the time quantum) as it provides fair time allocation to each process.

It is a concurrency control mechanism analogous to database transactions for controlling access to shared memory in concurrent computing.],
[Front: What is software transactional memory? Back: Software transactional memory provides transactional memory semantics in a software runtime library or the programming language, and requires minimal hardware support (typically an atomic compare and swap operation, or equivalent). As the downside, software implementations usually come with a performance penalty, when compared to hardware solutions.],
[Front: Does PyPY have a GIL? Back: Yes. The GIL is very difficult to remove. You can use pypy-stm instead, which uses software transactional memory, but will suffer a performance penalty.],
[Front: How can a server deal with a SYN flood attack? Back: When it detects a large number of SYN packets at once, or the size of its SN (sequence number) data structure reaches a certain threshold of entries, it can switch to a stateless version, where it send SN responses as signed values with a timestamp, and if it receives one back it lets them through without needing a lookup table.],
[Front: What is a stack canary? Back: It's a buffer overflow defense where a random value is pushed onto the stack after the saved EBP, and before tearing down the stack frame, the value is checked. Any buffer flow targeting the return instruction pointer would have to have overwritten this value.],
[Front: What type of buffer overflow protection does gcc and Visual Studio employ? Back: They use a stack check guard of bytes before and after the buffer's allocated memory. Once values are written to the buffer, the bytes are checked to ensure they are still the same.],

Chapter 3: Building Applications with Actors
- How can actors be used to build applications?
- How do actors provide scalability and low administrative overhead","[Front: What is an actor? Back: Briefly, actors are a lot like message queues without the configuration and message broker installation overhead. They’re like programmable message queues shrunk to microsize—you can easily create thousands, even millions of them. They don’t “do” anything unless they’re sent a message. Messages are simple data structures that can’t be changed after they’ve been created, or in a single word, they’re immutable. Actors can receive messages one at a time and execute some behavior whenever a message is received. Unlike queues, they can also send messages (to other actors). Everything an actor does is executed asynchronously. Simply put, you can send a message to an actor without waiting for a response. Actors aren’t like threads, but messages sent to them are pushed through on a thread at some point in time. How actors are connected to threads is configurable - this is not a hardwired relationship. For now the most important aspect of actors is that you build applications by sending and receiving messages. A message could be processed locally on some available thread, or remotely on another server. Exactly where the message is processed and where the actor lives are things you can decide later, which is very different compared to hardcoding threads and RPC style networking. Actors make it easy to build your application out of small parts that resemble networked services, only shrunk to microsize in footprint and administrative overhead.]"

This allows the programmer to build pipelines that process data in a series of steps (i.e. a series of actions applied to the data), in which each action is decorated with additional processing rules provided by the monad. A monad is defined by a return operator that creates values, and a bind operator used to link the actions in the pipeline.],

3.1 What is ZooKeeper?
   - Apache ZooKeeper is a centralized service used for maintaining configuration information, distributed synchronization, and providing group services. It assists in managing complex distributed applications.

3.2 Understanding Orthogonality
   - Orthogonality in programming language design guarantees consistent results when using various language features together. It reduces side effects and promotes feasible and compact designs of complex systems.","[Front: What is the problem that serialization introduces? Back: The overhead of serializing and deserializing. It's all expensive, and for Python, it can be terribly slow.],
[Front: What does the Python bisect module do? Back: The bisect module, part of the standard library, provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion. For long lists of items with expensive comparison operations, this can be an improvement over the more common approach.],
[Front: What is PycURL? Back: PycURL is a Python interface to libcurl. PycURL can be used to fetch objects identified by a URL from a Python program, similar to the urllib Python module. PycURL is mature, very fast, and supports a lot of features. PycURL is targeted at an advanced developer - if you need dozens of concurrent, fast and reliable connections or any of the sophisticated features listed above then PycURL is for you. The main drawback of PycURL is that it is a relatively thin layer over libcurl without any of those nice Pythonic class hierarchies. This means it has a somewhat steep learning curve unless you are already familiar with libcurl's C API.],
[Front: How does PycURL compare to requests? Back: PycURL can handle a large number of multiple concurrent requests. When reusing connections, it can perform more than 2,000 requests per second.  pycurl takes about 73 CPU-microseconds to issue a request when reusing a connection requests takes about 526 CPU-microseconds to issue a request when reusing a connection pycurl takes about 165 CPU-microseconds to open a new connection and issue a request (no connection reuse), or ~92 microseconds to open requests takes about 1078 CPU-microseconds to open a new connection and issue a request (no connection reuse), or ~552 microseconds to open],
[Front: What is ZooKeeper? Back: Apache ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed. Has Java and C interfaces.],
[Front: What is orthogonality? Back: In mathematical terms, it means being perpendicular.  Orthogonality in programming language design is the ability to use various language features in arbitrary combinations with consistent results.  Orthogonality is a system design property which guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system. Typically this is achieved through the separation of concerns and encapsulation, and it is essential for feasible and compact designs of complex systems. The emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration, i.e., non-orthogonal design of modules and interfaces. Orthogonality reduces testing and development time because it is easier to verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them.],
[Front: When dealing with scaling, how can you deal with rapidly increasing counters, like YouTube video views? Back: You can add randomness to a monotonic counter, because as long as people can see it is increasing somewhat monotonically, it doesn't need to be 100% accurate. And avoids need to lock it in a transaction.],
[Front: What is exponential backoff and when is it used? Back: Binary exponential backoff or truncated binary exponential backoff refers to an algorithm used to space out repeated retransmissions of network or other service requests, often as part of congestion avoidance.]"

   - A b-tree data structure can be used to efficiently manage a leaderboard, where each node handles a range of scores.

1.2 Adding jitter in system design
   - Jitter is added to avoid thundering herds, preventing operations from stacking up. It introduces randomness and prevents synchronization issues in distributed applications.

Chapter 2: Configuring Cron Intervals and Python's functools
2.1 Using prime numbers for cron intervals
   - Distinct prime numbers can be used to set periodicities in cron or other system intervals, reducing the chances of coinciding schedules.

2.2 Exploring Python's functools package
   - The functools package provides tools for adapting or extending functions, including decorators, comparison operations, caching, and reducing data sets.

Chapter 3: Proxy Servers and Collapsed Forwarding
3.1 Understanding proxy servers
   - A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and backend origin servers, often used for filtering, logging, and transforming requests.

3.2 Collapsed forwarding with proxy servers
   - Proxy servers can collapse similar requests into a single request, improving efficiency. Additionally, collapsing requests for spatially close data can further optimize performance.

Please note that the textbook chapters are created based on the provided flashcards. They can be further refined and expanded based on the specific requirements and structure of the textbook","[Front: What data structure could be used to efficiently manage a leaderboard? Back: A b-tree where each node manages a subset of the range of the worst to best scores.],
[Front: What does adding jitter in system design help you avoid? Back: If your system doesn’t jitter then you get thundering herds. Distributed applications are really weather systems. Debugging them is as deterministic as predicting the weather. Jitter introduces more randomness because surprisingly, things tend to stack up.],
[Front: What is an example of adding jitter to a caching system? Back: Cache expirations. For a popular video they cache things as best they can. The most popular video they might cache for 24 hours. If everything expires at one time then every machine will calculate the expiration at the same time. This creates a thundering herd. By jittering you are saying randomly expire between 18-30 hours. That prevents things from stacking up. They use this all over the place. Systems have a tendency to self synchronize as operations line up and try to destroy themselves. Fascinating to watch. You get slow disk system on one machine and everybody is waiting on a request so all of a sudden all these other requests on all these other machines are completely synchronized. This happens when you have many machines and you have many events. Each one actually removes entropy from the system so you have to add some back in.],
[Front: What value can you make cron or other system intervals so they don't coincide? Back: Use distinct prime numbers for periodicities.],
[Front: What Python package provides tools for adapting or extending functions and other callable objects, without completely rewriting them? Back: functools offers: Decorators Comparison Rich Comparison Collation Order Caching Reducing a Data Set Generic Functions],
[Front: What is a proxy server? Back: A proxy server is an intermediate piece of hardware/software that receives requests from clients and relays them to the backend origin servers. Typically, proxies are used to filter requests, log requests, or sometimes transform requests (by adding/removing headers, encrypting/decrypting, or compression).],
[Front: What is collapsed forwarding? Back: A proxy server can collapse the same (or similar) requests together into one request, and then return the single result to the requesting clients.  Another great way to use the proxy is to not just collapse requests for the same data, but also to collapse requests for data that is spatially close together in the origin store (consecutively on disk).]"

This is because the cache is serving data from memory, it is very fast, and it doesn't mind multiple requests for the same result. But if the cache was located on the other side of the proxy server, then there would be additional latency with every request before the cache, and this could hinder performance.],
[Front: What are some popular proxies? Back: HAProxy Squid Varnish],
[Front: Why do indexes tend to slow down writes? Back: Since you must both write the data and update the index.],
[Front: What is the role of a load balancer? Back: The role is to distribute load across a set of nodes responsible for servicing requests. This allows multiple nodes to transparently service the same function in a system. Their main purpose is to handle a lot of simultaneous connections and route those connections to one of the request nodes, allowing the system to scale to service more requests by just adding nodes.],
[Front: What is a drawback of advanced features in a load balancer? Back: Advanced features can make problem diagnosis cumbersome. For example, when it comes to high load situations, load balancers will remove nodes that may be slow or timing out (because of too many requests), but that only exacerbates the situation for the other nodes.],
[Front: What is a benefit of adding asynchrony to a system? Back: It keeps clients from holding connections to servers when waiting for a response for a task that could simply be deferred. This reduces load on servers that are performing writes, for example, and lets them perform a task when ready, not on-demand.]"

Back: In a synchronous system, there is no differentiation between request and reply, and they therefore cannot be managed separately. In an asynchronous system the client requests a task, the service responds with a message acknowledging the task was received, and then the client can periodically check the status of the task, only requesting the result once it has completed.  While the client is waiting for an asynchronous request to be completed it is free to perform other work, even making asynchronous requests of other services.]"

[Front: Does asynchronous code tend to be CPU-bound or I/O bound?

[Front: How do context switches perform under virtualization? Back: On average, it's 2.5x to 3x more expensive to do a context switch when using virtualization. My guess is that this is due to the fact that the guest OS can't update the page table itself, so when it attempts to change it, the hypervisor intervenes, which causes an extra 2 context switches (one to get inside the hypervisor, one to get out, back to the guest OS).],

[Front: What are 2 examples of in-memory caches? Back: Memcached and Redis are both examples of in-memory caches],
[Front: What is write-through cache? Back: Write-through cache directs write I/O onto cache and through to underlying permanent storage before confirming I/O completion to the host. This ensures data updates are safely stored on, for example, a shared storage array, but has the disadvantage that I/O still experiences latency based on writing to that storage. Write-through cache is good for applications that write and then re-read data frequently as data is stored in cache and results in low read latency.],
[Front: What is write-back cache? Back: Write-back cache is where write I/O is directed to cache and completion is immediately confirmed to the host. This results in low latency and high throughput for write-intensive applications, but there is data availability exposure risk because the only copy of the written data is in cache. As we will discuss later, suppliers have added resiliency with products that duplicate writes. Users need to consider whether write-back cache solutions offer enough protection as data is exposed until it is staged to external storage. Write-back cache is the best performing solution for mixed workloads as both read and write I/O have similar response time levels.],
[Front: What is read-through cache? Back: An item is accessed from cache, and if it's a cache miss, the data will be read from persistent storage (perhaps with a callback) and then placed into cache. The response is then sent back to the host.]"

[Front: What is a platform layer? Back: Web applications to communicate with a platform layer which in turn communicates with your databases.   First, separating the platform and web application allow you to scale the pieces independently. If you add a new API, you can add platform servers without adding unnecessary capacity for your web application tier.   Second, adding a platform layer can be a way to reuse your infrastructure for multiple products or interfaces (a web application, an API, an iPhone app, etc) without writing too much redundant boilerplate code for dealing with caches, databases, etc.  Third, a sometimes underappreciated aspect of platform layers is that they make it easier to scale an organization. At their best, a platform exposes a crisp product-agnostic interface which masks implementation details. If done well, this allows multiple independent teams to develop utilizing the platform's capabilities, as well as another team implementing/optimizing the platform itself.],

Back: DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. It is a type of semiconductor memory in which the memory is stored in the form of a charge. Each memory cell in a DRAM is made of a transistor and a capacitor. The data is stored in the capacitor. Capacitors loose charge due to leakage and hence DRAM's are volatile devices. To keep the data in the memory, the device must be regularly refreshed whereas SRAM is static, so it will retain a value as long as power is supplied. SRAM is typically faster than DRAM since it doesn't have refresh cycles. Since each SRAM memory cell is comprised of 6 Transistors unlike a DRAM memory cell, which is comprised of 1 Transistor and 1 Capacitor, the cost per memory cell is far greater in an SRAM compared to a DRAM.],
[Front: What is the difference between a CPU core and a CPU thread? Back: The difference between a core and a thread is that separate cores have separate copies of (almost) all the hardware resources. The cores can run completely independently unless they are using the same resources–e.g., the connections to the outside - at the same time. Threads, on the other hand, share almost all of the processor’s resources. Intel’s implementation of threads has only separate registers for the threads and even that is limited, some registers are shared.],

Replication is used for global availability and geographic locality; clients automatically failover between replicas. Spanner automatically reshards data across machines as the amount of data or the number of servers changes, and it automatically migrates data across machines (even across datacenters) to balance load and in response to failures.

Too large to keep in memory. A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not, thus a Bloom filter has a 100% recall rate. In other words, a query returns either ""possibly in set"" or ""definitely not in set"".

[Front: In a maximum flow problem, what is the minimum cut? Back: The min cut is the maximum flow through the graph.],
[Front: What is the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm? Back: The Ford–Fulkerson method or Ford–Fulkerson algorithm (FFA) is a greedy algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network. It is called a ""method"" instead of an ""algorithm"" as the approach to finding augmenting paths in a residual graph is not fully specified or it is specified in several implementations with different running times. The name ""Ford–Fulkerson"" is often also used for the Edmonds–Karp algorithm, which is a specialization of Ford–Fulkerson.],
[Front: What is the running time for the disjoint set data structure? Back: Due to merging smaller disjoint sets into larger ones (called union by rank) (during union) and performing path compression (during find), the amortized time per operation is only O(alpha(n)), where alpha(n) is the inverse of the function and A is the extremely fast-growing Ackermann function. Since alpha(n) is the inverse of this function, alpha(n) is less than 5 for all remotely practical values of n. Thus, the amortized running time per operation is effectively a small constant.  The worst-case for find() is Theta(log u) where u is the number of unions, and no finds have been done to allow for path compression yet.],
[Front: In testing, what is an oracle? Back: Software testers and software engineers can use an oracle as a mechanism for determining whether a test has passed or failed.

"Chapter Title: Hash Table Conflict Resolution

1. What is stored in a TCB?
- Registers, program counter, stack counter.

2. What is separate chaining?
- In hash table conflict resolution, each bucket is independent and has some sort of linked list of entries with the same index. The time for hash table operations is the time to find the bucket (which is constant) plus the time for the list operation. In a good hash table, each bucket has zero or one entries, and sometimes two or three, but rarely more than that. Therefore, structures that are efficient in time and space for these cases are preferred. Structures that are efficient for a fairly large number of entries per bucket are not needed or desirable. If these cases happen often, the hashing function needs to be fixed.

3. What is open addressing?
- In hash table conflict resolution, all entry records are stored in the bucket array itself. When a new entry has to be inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the hashed-to slot and proceeding in some probe sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found. When searching for an entry, the buckets are scanned in the same sequence, until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates that there is no such key in the table. The name ""open addressing"" refers to the fact that the location (""address"") of the item is not determined by its hash value. (This method is also called closed hashing; it should not be confused with ""open hashing"" or ""closed addressing"" that usually mean separate chaining.)

4. What is the length of the longest chain in a hash table using separate chaining?

3. What order of node and its children are involved in a preorder traversal?
- Preorder traversal involves visiting the node, then its left child, and finally its right child (node leftChild rightChild).

4. What order of node and its children are involved in a postorder traversal?
- Postorder traversal involves visiting the left child, then the right child, and finally the node (leftChild rightChild node).

[Front: What is counting sort? Back: Counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items. However, it is often used as a subroutine in another sorting algorithm, radix sort, that can handle larger keys more efficiently.],
[Front: What is radix sort? Back: Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value.  Two classifications of radix sorts are least significant digit (LSD) radix sorts and most significant digit (MSD) radix sorts. LSD radix sorts process the integer representations starting from the least digit and move towards the most significant digit. MSD radix sorts work the other way around.],

"Chapter 1: Iterator Pattern
1.1 Introduction
The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It encapsulates the traversal of a collection and separates the iterator's responsibility from the collection's responsibility.

1.2 Key Concepts
- Aggregate object: An object that contains a collection of elements.
- Iterator: An object that provides a way to access elements sequentially from the aggregate object.

1.3 Implementation
To implement the Iterator pattern, we define an Iterator interface that provides methods like next() and hasNext() to traverse the elements. The concrete iterator classes implement this interface and handle the traversal logic.

1.4 Advantages
- Allows the client to access elements of a collection without knowing its internal structure.
- Supports multiple iterations over the same collection concurrently.
- Enables the creation of custom iterators for different types of collections.

Chapter 2: Mediator Pattern
2.1 Introduction
The Mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and allows variations in their interactions independently.

2.2 Key Concepts
- Mediator: An object that defines the communication protocol between a set of objects.
- Colleague objects: Objects that interact with each other through a mediator.

2.3 Implementation
In the Mediator pattern, we introduce a mediator object that handles the communication between colleague objects. The colleagues communicate with each other indirectly through the mediator, reducing their dependencies.

2.4 Advantages
- Reduces coupling between objects by removing direct references.
- Centralizes the communication logic, making it easier to modify and maintain.
- Promotes a more scalable and flexible design by allowing variations in interactions.

Chapter 3: Memento Pattern
3.1 Introduction
The Memento pattern allows capturing and externalizing an object's internal state without violating encapsulation. It enables the object to be restored to this state later.

3.2 Key Concepts
- Originator: An object whose state needs to be saved.
- Memento: An object that stores the internal state of the originator.

3.3 Implementation
In the Memento pattern, the originator is responsible for creating and restoring mementos. The caretaker object holds the memento and doesn't modify its contents. The memento itself encapsulates the state of the originator.

3.4 Advantages
- Allows an object to save and restore its internal state.
- Enables undo and redo operations by storing multiple states.
- Facilitates the separation of concerns by separating state storage from the originator.

Chapter 4: Observer Pattern
4.1 Introduction
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes in one object's state trigger automatic updates in all its dependents. It decouples the observer objects from the subject, ensuring loose coupling.

4.2 Key Concepts
- Subject: An object that maintains a list of observers and notifies them of changes.
- Observer: An object that depends on the subject and receives updates when its state changes.

4.3 Implementation
In the Observer pattern, the subject maintains a list of observers and provides methods for attaching, detaching, and notifying them. The observers register with the subject to receive updates.

4.4 Advantages

- Enables dynamic switching of strategies at runtime.
- Allows easy addition of new strategies without modifying the existing code.

Chapter 3: Template Method Pattern
3.1 Introduction

- Concrete class: Subclasses that provide specific implementation for the abstract methods.

3.3 Implementation
In the Template Method pattern, the abstract class defines a template method that implements a common algorithm. It also includes hook methods that subclasses can optionally override to customize certain steps.

3.4 Advantages
- Reduces duplicate code by providing a common algorithm structure.
- Allows subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps.
- Ensures the algorithm's structure remains unchanged while allowing customization.

Chapter 4: Graham Scan Algorithm for Convex Hull
- How does a Graham scan work in finding convex hull? 
The Graham scan algorithm finds the convex hull in O(n log n) time. It involves the following steps:
1. Sort all points based on their polar angle with respect to the lowest point.
2. Initialize a stack and push the first three points.
3. Iterate through the remaining points, making only left turns while going around the perimeter counter-clockwise.
4. When encountering a right turn, backtrack by popping points off the stack until the turn becomes a left turn.","[Front: How does a half-adder handle an addition? Back: XOR for the sum and AND for the carry],

"Chapter 1: Jarvis March Algorithm for Convex Hull
- How does the Jarvis march work in finding convex hull? 
The Jarvis march algorithm finds the convex hull starting with the leftmost point. The steps are as follows:
1. Go through each point to the right of the current point, considering it as a pivot.
2. Find the point that is most clockwise with respect to the current point. This becomes the new current point.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the starting point is reached, forming the convex hull.

"This chapter delves into the topic of arrays and their operations. Specifically, we will discuss both unordered and sorted arrays and explore the time complexities associated with different operations on them. The operations we will cover include:

1. Find (unordered array): Finding an element in an unordered array requires iterating through the array until a match is found. As a result, the time complexity for this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the array.

2. Add (unordered array): Adding an element to the end of an unordered array can be done in constant time, denoted as O(1). This operation does not depend on the size of the array.

3. Delete (unordered array): Deleting an element from an unordered array involves searching for the element and removing it. The time complexity for this operation is O(n), as it requires iterating through the array to find the element to remove.

4. Find (sorted array): When dealing with a sorted array, we can utilize the binary search algorithm to find an element. The time complexity of finding an element in a sorted array using binary search is O(log n), where n is the size of the array.

5. Add (sorted array): Adding an element to a sorted array requires finding the appropriate position to maintain the sorted order. This operation has a time complexity of O(n) because elements may need to be shifted to make space for the new element.

6. Delete an element from a sorted array: Similar to adding, deleting an element from a sorted array also requires maintaining the sorted order. The time complexity for this operation is O(n), as elements may need to be shifted after the deletion.

7. Add (unordered singly linked list): Adding an element to the front of an unordered singly linked list can be done in constant time, denoted as O(1).

8. Find (ordered singly linked list): When dealing with an ordered singly linked list, finding an element requires iterating through the list until the element is found. The time complexity for this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list.

9. Add (ordered singly linked list): Adding an element to an ordered singly linked list requires finding the appropriate position to maintain the sorted order. This operation has a time complexity of O(n) as elements may need to be traversed to find the correct position.

10. Delete (Binary Search Tree): Deleting an element from a binary search tree depends on the height of the tree and is typically denoted as O(h), where h is the height of the tree. The time complexity can range from O(log n) to O(n) in the worst-case scenario.

1. Find (Balanced Binary Search Tree): Finding an element in a balanced binary search tree has a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. The balanced structure ensures efficient searching by maintaining a balanced height.

2. Add (Balanced Binary Search Tree): Adding an element to a balanced binary search tree also has a time complexity of O(log N). The balance is maintained during the insertion process, ensuring that the tree remains balanced.

3. Delete (Balanced Binary Search Tree): Deleting an element from a balanced binary search tree also has a time complexity of O(log N), thanks to the self-balancing property of the tree.

Additionally, we will discuss the concept of a max-heap. A max-heap is a special type of priority queue where each element is assigned a ""priority"" value. Elements with higher priorities are served before lower priorities. Understanding max-heaps will enhance your understanding of priority queues and their applications.

Chapter 3: Sorting Algorithms
3.1 Stable Sorting
- Stable sorting: Stable sorting refers to the property of sorting algorithms where items with the same key are sorted based on their relative position in the original permutation.

3.2 Internal Sorting
- Internal sorting: Internal sorting is any data sorting process that takes place entirely within the main memory of a computer. It is feasible when the data can fit entirely in the main memory. This sorting approach avoids the slowdown caused by reading or writing data from slower media such as hard disks.

3.3 External Sorting
- External sorting: External sorting refers to sorting algorithms designed to handle massive amounts of data that do not fit into the main memory. It typically uses a hybrid sort-merge strategy, where data chunks that fit in memory are sorted and written to temporary files in the sorting phase. In the merge phase, these sorted subfiles are combined into a single larger file. Mergesort is a commonly used algorithm for external sorting.

3.4 Advantages and Disadvantages of Merge Sort
- Advantages of merge sort: Merge sort is suitable for a linked list and external sorting scenarios due to its characteristics.

[Front: What is internal sorting? Back: An internal sort is any data sorting process that takes place entirely within the main memory of a computer. This is possible whenever the data to be sorted is small enough to all be held in the main memory. For sorting larger datasets, it may be necessary to hold only a chunk of data in memory at a time, since it won't all fit. The rest of the data is normally held on some larger, but slower medium, like a hard-disk. Any reading or writing of data to and from this slower media can slow the sortation process considerably.],

"Advantages of Heap Sort:
Heap sort offers several advantages:
1. It does not require recursion, making it simpler to implement.
2. It is suitable for large datasets, as it has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases.
3. Heap sort has excellent data locality, which means it efficiently uses the cache memory and reduces memory access time.

Disadvantage of Heap Sort:
One disadvantage of heap sort is that it is usually slower than other sorting algorithms such as merge sort and quick sort. This is because heap sort has more overhead due to maintaining the heap property during each iteration.

Articulation Vertex:
An articulation vertex, also known as a cut vertex, refers to a vertex in a graph that is crucial in maintaining connectivity. Removing an articulation vertex from a graph may cause the graph to become disconnected or split into multiple components.

Chromatic Number:
The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors required to color its vertices in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. 

Long-term Issues Involved in Machine Learning:
Machine learning involves several long-term issues that researchers and practitioners need to consider:
1. Technical Debt: Accumulated technical challenges and suboptimal design choices over time.
2. Lack of Clear Abstraction Barriers: Ensuring proper abstraction and modularization in the machine learning pipeline can be challenging.
3. Changing Anything Changes Everything: Making even minor changes to a model or the training data can have significant effects on the overall system.
4. Feedback Loop: The usage of a model can change the model itself, leading to a complex feedback loop.
5. Usage Based on Your Model Changes the Model: Deploying a model in a real-world setting may lead to changes in the model's behavior due to user feedback and data distribution.
6. Attractive Nuisance: A successful model in one domain may not fit well in another domain, leading to potential issues and performance degradation.
7. Non-Stationarity: Dealing with data that evolves or changes over time, requiring continuous monitoring and retraining.
8. Tracking Data Dependencies: Understanding the origin of data and handling new data while deciding how much of the old data to reuse.

"Matrix Multiplication Properties:
When performing matrix multiplication, certain properties hold:
- When multiplying a 5x2 matrix and a 2x5 matrix, the resulting matrix will have dimensions 5x5.
- Matrix multiplication is not commutative. In general, AxB does not equal BxA.
- Matrix multiplication is associative. For matrices A, B, and C, (AxB)xC = Ax(BxC).
- To obtain the identity matrix, which yields the original matrix when multiplied, an MxN matrix must be multiplied by an NxN matrix. The identity matrix has all zeros except for ones along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.
- For a matrix to have an inverse, it must be square, meaning the number of rows is equal to the number of columns.
- Inverting a matrix means multiplying it by a specific matrix so that the product is the identity matrix.
- The numpy library in Python provides functions such as numpy.linalg.inv and numpy.linalg.pinv to compute the inverse of a matrix, even if the matrix is non-invertible","[Front: When multiplying a 5x2 matrix and a 2x5 matrix, what are the dimensions of the final matrix? Back: 5x5],

"Chapter 1: Invertible Matrices and Transpose
1.1 Invertible Matrices
- An invertible matrix, also known as a non-singular or non-degenerate matrix, is a square matrix that has an inverse.
- In other words, if matrix A is invertible, there exists matrix B such that AB = BA = I, where I is the identity matrix.
- Two terms that can be used to describe invertible matrices are ""singular"" and ""degenerate"".

1.2 Transpose of a Matrix
- The transpose of a matrix, denoted as B, is obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix A.
- Specifically, if A = [Aij], then B = [Bji], where Aij is the element at the ith row and jth column of matrix A.","[Front: What are 2 words for matrices that are invertible? Back: - singular - degenerate],

"Chapter 2: Machine Learning Fundamentals
2.1 Supervised Learning
- Supervised learning is a type of machine learning task where the goal is to learn a function from labeled training data.
- The training data consists of a set of training examples, each containing an input object and a corresponding desired output value.
- These labeled examples are used to train the model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

2.2 Regression Problems
- Regression problems involve predicting a continuously-valued output.
- It refers to the estimation of continuous response variables, as opposed to discrete response variables used in classification problems.

2.3 Classification Problems
- Classification problems aim to identify the category or sub-population to which a new observation belongs.
- The classification model is trained using a set of labeled data, where the category membership is known.

2.4 Unsupervised Learning
- Unsupervised learning involves inferring hidden structure from unlabeled data, without the use of labeled examples.
- There is no error or reward signal to evaluate potential solutions, distinguishing it from supervised and reinforcement learning.

2.5 Machine Learning Terminologies
- The number of training examples is often represented by the symbol m.
- In machine learning, regression and classification are two common types of problems that utilize supervised learning.","[Front: What is another name for quadratic? Back: 2nd-order polynomial],

"Chapter 3: Linear Regression and Gradient Descent
3.1 Linear Regression with One Variable
- Linear regression with one variable, also known as univariate linear regression, models the relationship between a single input variable and the output variable.

3.2 Gradient Descent
- Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the local minimum of a cost function.
- It takes steps proportional to the negative gradient (partial derivative or tangent) of the function at the current point.

3.3 Batch Gradient Descent
- Batch gradient descent refers to the variant of gradient descent where all training examples are used to calculate each step.
- It updates the model parameters based on the average gradient across all training examples.

3.4 Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
- Linear regression with multiple variables, also known as multivariate linear regression, extends the univariate case to include multiple input features.

3.5 Feature Scaling
- Feature scaling is the process of normalizing the values of input features to a specific range.
- It helps gradient descent converge faster and prevents the function from oscillating for extended periods.

3.6 Mean Normalization
- Mean normalization is a method of scaling a feature's values to fall within a range relative to each other.
- It involves subtracting the mean value and dividing by a range (e.g., standard deviation) to normalize the feature.

3.7 Convergence of Gradient Descent
- Choosing a sufficiently small learning rate (alpha) allows gradient descent to eventually converge to the optimal solution.
- Convergence implies that the algorithm reaches a point where further iterations do not significantly change the model's parameters","[Front: What is another term for linear regression with one variable? Back: Univariate linear regression],

9. Building a heap in linear time: Building a heap can be done in linear time by leveraging the property that a tree of size n nodes will have floor(n/2^h) nodes with height >= h. The last half of nodes in the tree are already leaves, so no work needs to be done on them. By going bottom-up and satisfying the heap property one level at a time, each level up the tree requires at most one additional operation compared to the level below it. This results in a time complexity of O(n) for building the heap.

4. What is a Binary Search Tree?
   - A binary tree is a data structure where each node has a comparable key and satisfies the restriction that the key in any node is larger than the keys in all nodes in that node's left subtree and smaller than the keys in all nodes in that node's right subtree.

5. What is an AVL tree?
   - An AVL tree is a balanced binary search tree where the height of every node and that of its sibling differ by at most 1.

6. What is a red-black tree?
   - A red-black tree is a type of binary search tree that satisfies the following properties:
     - Red links lean left.
     - No node has two links connected to it.
     - The tree has perfect black balance: every path from the root to a null link has the same number of blacks.

7. What is a splay tree?
   - A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree where recently accessed elements are moved to the root so they are quick to access again.

8. What is a treap?
   - A treap is a data structure that combines properties of binary search trees and heaps. Each key in the tree has a random priority assigned to it. It must maintain two properties:
     - The keys are in order with respect to their values, as in a typical binary search tree.
     - The keys are in heap order with respect to their priorities, which means no key has a key of lower priority as an ancestor. It provides O(log N) expected time for all operations and O(N) worst case time complexity.

Back: 64 bytes.  -- extra below --  To know the sizes, you need to look it up using the documentation for the processor, afaik there is no programatic way to do it. On the plus side however, most cache lines are of a standard size, based on intels standards. On x86 cache lines are 64 bytes, however, to prevent false sharing, you need to follow the guidelines of the processor you are targeting (intel has some special notes on its netburst based processors), generally you need to align to 64 bytes for this (intel states that you should also avoid crossing 16 byte boundries).  To do this in C or C++ requires that you use aligned_malloc or one of the compiler specific specifiers such as __attribute__((align(64))) or __declspec(align(64)). To pad between members in a struct to split them onto different cache lines, you need on insert a member big enough to align it to the next 64 byte boundery]"
"1. Latency is the delay from input into a system to the desired outcome. It represents the time interval between a stimulus and response.

2. A y-fast trie is a data structure used for storing integers from a bounded domain. It provides support for exact and predecessor or successor queries. The time complexity for these operations is O(log log M), where M is the maximum value in the domain. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of stored values. The y-fast trie was proposed by Dan Willard in 1982 as an improvement over the x-fast trie, reducing the space usage.

"1. A van Emde Boas tree, also known as a vEB tree, is a tree-based data structure that supports efficient insertions, deletions, lookups, successor queries, and predecessor queries. It achieves a time complexity of O(log log U), where U represents the universe of items to store. The items are organized into clusters of size sqrt(U). The structure consists of clusters, each being a smaller vEB structure of size sqrt(n). Additionally, there is a ""summary"" structure that keeps track of nonempty clusters. The vEB tree was developed by Peter van Emde Boas and his team in 1975.

2. A compressed trie is a variation of the trie data structure in which non-branching paths are compressed into a single edge. This compression technique reduces the space required to store the trie by eliminating redundant nodes.

3. With a hash table, the ordering of the keys is lost. Hash tables provide efficient lookup operations based on keys, but they do not preserve the original order of the keys.

4. To convert a file separated by spaces into a newline-delimited format and then sort it alphabetically, you can use the following sed command: sed 's/ /\n/g' words.txt | sort

5. To print columns 2, 3, and 6 from the output of the date command, you can use the following awk command: date | awk '{print $2, $3, $6}'

6. To change a file delimited by colons (:) into a tab-delimited format, you can use the following sed command: cat /etc/passwd | sed 's/:/\t/g'

7. To output a file with line numbers, you can use the cat command with the -n option: cat -n somefile

Back: The van Emde Boas tree supports insertions, deletions, lookups, successor queries, and predecessor queries in time O(log log U), where U is the universe of items to store. Items are stored in clusters of size sqrt(U).   The van Emde Boas data structure divides the range {0,...,n−1} into blocks of size sqrt(n), which we call clusters. Each cluster is itself a vEB structure of size sqrt(n). In addition, there is a “summary” structure that keeps track of which clusters are nonempty.  More detail: A van Emde Boas tree (or van Emde Boas priority queue), also known as a vEB tree, is a tree data structure which implements an associative array with m-bit integer keys. It performs all operations in O(log m) time, or equivalently in O(log log M) time, where M = 2m is the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the tree. The M is not to be confused with the actual number of elements stored in the tree, by which the performance of other tree data-structures is often measured. The vEB tree has good space efficiency when it contains a large number of elements, as discussed below. It was invented by a team led by Dutch computer scientist Peter van Emde Boas in 1975.],

3. Downsides of using an adjacency matrix to represent a graph: There are two main downsides of using an adjacency matrix. First, finding all the outgoing edges from a vertex takes O(n) time even if there aren't very many edges. Second, the space cost is high for ""sparse graphs,"" those with much fewer than n^2 edges, as it requires O(n^2) space.

4. When using an adjacency list is expensive: Finding predecessors of a node u can be extremely expensive when using adjacency lists. It requires looking through every list of every node in time O(n + e), where e is the total number of edges. However, if finding predecessors is a frequently performed operation, we can store a second copy of the graph with the edges reversed to optimize this.

5. When adjacency lists are most useful: Adjacency lists are most useful when we mostly want to enumerate outgoing edges of each node. This is common in search tasks, where we want to find a path from one node to another or compute the distances between pairs of nodes. If other operations are important, we can optimize them by augmenting the adjacency list representation.

This is common in search tasks, where we want to find a path from one node to another or compute the distances between pairs of nodes.

"1. What is the memory needed to store an adjacency list?
   - Answer: Theta( |V| + |E| )
   - Explanation: Storing an adjacency list requires memory proportional to the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The adjacency list consists of an array of |V| elements, each containing a list of neighbors for the corresponding vertex. The total memory required is proportional to the sum of the number of vertices and edges.

2. What is the memory needed to store an adjacency matrix?
   - Answer: Theta(|V|^2)
   - Explanation: Storing an adjacency matrix requires memory proportional to the square of the number of vertices in the graph. The adjacency matrix is a 2D array of |V| x |V| elements, where each element represents the presence or absence of an edge between two vertices.

3. How would you implement a queue with a linked list?
   - Answer: Use a tail pointer. Push new items at the tail, pop items at the head. Both operations are constant-time.
   - Explanation: To implement a queue with a linked list, we can use a tail pointer to keep track of the last element in the queue. New items are pushed at the tail by creating a new node and updating the tail pointer. Items are popped from the head by removing the first node and updating the head pointer. Both push and pop operations can be done in constant time.

4. How would you implement a stack with a linked list?
   - Answer: Push and pop items at the head. Both operations are constant-time.
   - Explanation: To implement a stack with a linked list, we can push items at the head of the linked list and pop items from the head as well. Push operation involves creating a new node and updating the head pointer. Pop operation involves removing the first node and updating the head pointer. Both push and pop operations can be done in constant time.

5. What preference of nodes vs leaves does preorder traversal give on a tree?
   - Answer: Nodes first, leaves later.
   - Explanation: Preorder traversal visits the nodes of a tree before visiting its leaves. It starts at the root and then recursively visits the left subtree in preorder traversal, followed by the right subtree in preorder traversal.

6. What preference of nodes vs leaves does postorder traversal give on a tree?
   - Answer: Leaves first, internal nodes later.
   - Explanation: Postorder traversal visits the leaves of a tree before visiting its internal nodes. It starts at the leftmost leaf and then recursively visits the leaves in postorder traversal, followed by visiting the internal nodes.

"1. Using a stack to keep track of unvisited nodes gives what kind of traversal?
   - Answer: DFS
   - Explanation: Using a stack to keep track of unvisited nodes during a graph traversal results in Depth-First Search (DFS). This is because the stack follows the principle of ""last-in, first-out"" and explores the neighbors of the most recently visited node in a recursive manner.

2. Using a queue to keep track of unvisited nodes gives what kind of traversal?
   - Answer: BFS
   - Explanation: Using a queue to keep track of unvisited nodes during a graph traversal results in Breadth-First Search (BFS). This is because the queue follows the principle of ""first-in, first-out"" and explores the neighbors of the least recently visited node in a level-by-level manner.

3. In a highly connected graph of n vertices, how many cycles can there be?

   - Explanation: In a highly connected graph with n vertices, there can be a maximum of (n - 1)! cycles. Enumerating all cycles in such a graph can be done using techniques like backtracking, but the number of cycles can be extremely large. Therefore, it is important to consider the computational complexity when dealing with highly connected graphs.","[Front: Using a stack to keep track of unvisited nodes gives what kind of traversal?

"1. What can you use to find if a graph is bipartite?
   - Answer: BFS. Using only 2 colors. When you encounter a new vertex, if it has no color, give it the opposite color of its parent vertex. If it is already colored the same, the graph is not bipartite.
   - Explanation: To determine if a graph is bipartite, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) with 2 colors. We assign one color (e.g., red) to the starting vertex and its neighbors with the opposite color (e.g., blue). During the BFS traversal, if we encounter a new vertex without a color, we assign it the opposite color of its parent vertex. If we encounter a vertex that is already colored with the same color as its parent, then the graph is not bipartite.

2. How can you find a cycle in a graph?
   - Answer: DFS. If you discover an edge that connects to an ancestor (previously discovered vertex), you have a cycle.
   - Explanation: To find a cycle in a graph, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS). While traversing the graph, if we encounter an edge that connects to a previously discovered vertex (ancestor), then a cycle exists in the graph.

3. What is an articulation vertex?
   - Answer: A vertex of a graph whose deletion disconnects the graph.
   - Explanation: An articulation vertex, also known as a cut vertex, is a vertex in a graph whose removal would result in the disconnection of the graph into multiple connected components. Removing an articulation vertex increases the number of connected components in the graph.

4. How can you find an articulation vertex?
   - Answer: DFS multiple times. Remove each edge one at a time, doing a DFS after each, to see if you end up with > 1 connected components. If you remove a node and then DFS and find you have fewer than m - 1 edges, you've deleted an articulation vertex. O(n(n+m)). A faster way, with a little more bookkeeping, can be done in O(n+m) time, if you do DFS and keep track of parents and make a note when you reach a back edge, which connects to an ancestor.
   - Explanation: To find an articulation vertex, we can perform multiple Depth-First Searches (DFS) on the graph. By removing each edge one at a time and performing a DFS after each removal, we can determine if the removal of a vertex creates more than one connected component. If removing a vertex results in fewer than m - 1 edges during the subsequent DFS, the removed vertex is an articulation vertex. This approach has a time complexity of O(n(n+m)). A faster way to find articulation vertices, with additional bookkeeping, can be done in O(n+m) time by keeping track of parents during DFS and identifying back edges that connect to an ancestor.

5. How could you identify errors in a DNA fragment assembly given many pairs of sequences, where item A must appear before B in the larger sequence?
   - Answer: Build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing all the left-right constraints. Any topological sort of the DAG is a consistent ordering. If there are cycles, there must be errors.
   - Explanation: To identify errors in DNA fragment assembly based on left-right constraints, we can construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where each fragment sequence is represented as a vertex, and the constraints are represented as directed edges from A to B if A must appear before B. By performing a topological sort on the DAG, we can obtain a consistent ordering of the fragment sequences. If there are cycles in the DAG, it indicates that there are errors in the assembly, as the constraints cannot be satisfied without violating the ordering","[Front: What can use to find if a graph is bipartite?

5. When talking about dynamic programming, what is feasibility?
In dynamic programming, feasibility refers to the rules or constraints that an algorithm must adhere to in reaching its solution. Feasibility is an important aspect of dynamic programming as it helps determine if a particular solution or subproblem is valid or not.

6. When talking about dynamic programming, what is optimality?
In dynamic programming, optimality refers to the property of an algorithm where the subsolutions of an optimal solution to a problem are themselves optimal solutions for their respective subproblems. This means that by solving smaller subproblems optimally, we can build up to an optimal solution for the larger problem.

7. What is dynamic programming?
Dynamic programming is a general-purpose algorithm design technique that is most often used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It involves breaking down a big instance of a problem into smaller instances and solving each instance in a bottom-up manner, storing the results in a table as we go. Dynamic programming is based on the principle of delaying commitment to particular choices in order to preserve alternative solutions that may be needed later. It is efficient when there are duplicate subproblems that can be avoided and when the subproblems can be enumerated in a suitable manner.

Back: Dynamic programming is a general-purpose algorithm design technique that is most often used to solve combinatorial optimization problems, where we are looking for the best possible input to some function chosen from an exponentially large search space.  There are two parts to dynamic programming. The first part is a programming technique: dynamic programming is essentially divide and conquer run in reverse: we solve a big instance of a problem by breaking it up recursively into smaller instances; but instead of carrying out the computation recursively from the top down, we start from the bottom with the smallest instances of the problem, solving each increasingly large instance in turn and storing the result in a table. The second part is a design principle: in building up our table, we are careful always to preserve alternative solutions we may need later, by delaying commitment to particular choices to the extent that we can.  The bottom-up aspect of dynamic programming is most useful when a straightforward recursion would produce many duplicate subproblems. It is most efficient when we can enumerate a class of subproblems that doesn't include too many extraneous cases that we don't need for our original problem.],

3. What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__?
__str__ is a special method in Python that is meant to provide a string representation of an object to make it more human-readable. It is used by the str() built-in function and the print() statement.

__repr__, on the other hand, is a special method that is meant to provide a string representation of an object that is unambiguous and can be used to recreate the object. It is used by the repr() built-in function and is often implemented as the constructor for the object.

In summary, __str__ is meant to be human-readable, while __repr__ is meant to represent the object and be unambiguous.

4. C: Method to find a given item x in a linked list. Head is a List *, x's data type is item_type.
Here is a method in C to find a given item x in a linked list:

List *search_list(List *l, item_type x) {
   if (l == NULL) 
      return NULL;
      
   if (l->item == x) 
      return l;
   else 
      return search_list(l->next, x);
}

This method takes a pointer to the head of the linked list and the item to search for. It recursively searches each node in the linked list until it finds a node with the given item or reaches the end of the list. If the item is found, the method returns a pointer to the node. If the end of the list is reached without finding the item, the method returns NULL","[Front: Write a dynamic programming version of computing Fibonacci for n.

"- What is a weak reference in Python?
  - A weak reference to an object does not affect its reference count. When the only remaining references to a referent are weak references, garbage collection is free to destroy the referent and reuse its memory for something else. A primary use for weak references is to implement caches or mappings holding large objects, where it’s desired that a large object not be kept alive solely because it appears in a cache or mapping.
- How does garbage collection work in CPython?
  - CPython uses reference counting and generational garbage collection. There are 3 age stages where objects live in memory. They all start in the ""nursery"", stage0, then if they survive a garbage collection, they are moved to stage1. The oldest objects that continue to survive in stage1 are promoted to stage2. The gc module has thresholds 700, 10, 10 for each stage. In order to decide when to run, the collector keeps track of the number of object allocations and deallocations since the last collection. When the number of allocations minus the number of deallocations exceeds threshold0, collection starts. If generation 0 has been examined more than threshold1 times since generation 1 has been examined, then generation 1 is examined as well. Similarly, threshold2 controls the number of collections of generation 1 before collecting generation 2.
- What is reference counting?
  - Reference counting is a method of garbage collection where the runtime keeps track of references to an object by manipulating the reference count on each assignment and delete (del), and when the reference count reaches 0 it means the object is practically unreachable. When the next collection runs, the object's memory will be reserved to allocate for new objects.
- What is a finalizer in Python?
  - A finalizer is a destructor, named __del__. __del__() is run when the runtime is about to destroy the object.
- What are 2 advantages of reference counting?
  - It is easy to implement and collects garbage incidentally without large pauses in execution.
- What are 2 disadvantages of reference counting?
  - It cannot collect circular references and manipulating reference counts at each assignment is very slow.","[Front: What is a weak reference in Python?

"- What is cyclic garbage collection?
  - Cyclic garbage collection is a method that detects and removes cycles unreachable by the program.
- How is garbage collection done in PyPy?
  - The GC implementation in PyPy is pluggable and can be chosen at runtime. PyPy uses mark and sweep, and generational garbage collection optimization. Marked objects are promoted from the nursery to an older generation. PyPy uses incremental garbage collection, where a major collection is split into multiple passes, each lasting only a few milliseconds.
- How does mark and sweep work?
  - In Java, mark and sweep perform a DFS on the graph of references to objects. This graph can have multiple roots. Each root is a reference that the program can access directly, such as a variable. The traversal marks each object by setting a mark bit. The sweep phase causes unmarked memory to be linked together in a list, so that memory can be reallocated. Sometimes this also triggers compaction, which moves used objects adjacent to each other in memory. The side effect of this is that free memory is also adjacent to free memory, allowing large blocks to be allocated.
- What is copying garbage collection (stop and copy)?
  - Copying garbage collection, also known as stop and copy, splits heap memory into two partitions: an old space and a new space. Live objects are found by performing a DFS of their reference graph and are moved into the new space. The new space becomes the old space, and unreachable objects are left in the old space to be overwritten the next time collection occurs. The movement of objects implicitly compacts the objects. However, one disadvantage is that only half of the heap space can be used","[Front: What is cyclic garbage collection? Back: Detects and removes cycles unreachable by the program.],

"1. How could you implement an LRU cache?
- An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache can be implemented using a fast lookup table like a hash table or binary tree, along with a linked list of items based on their usage. When an item is accessed or added, it is deleted from the linked list and added to the head of the list. To prune the cache, the linked list is traversed to remove trailing elements, which are also deleted from the storage (tree or hash table). Alternatively, a splay tree can be used as it moves accesses to the root. To prune items, the leaves can be identified and removed since the number of leaves will be approximately n/2.

2. What is a direct mapped cache?
- A direct mapped cache is a type of cache used in the CPU. It involves using the lower order bits of a given memory address modulo the number of cache lines to place or lookup data in the cache. If there is a collision, the existing data is overwritten.

3. What is a fully-associative cache?
- A fully-associative cache is another type of cache used in the CPU. In this scheme, lookups are performed on all cache lines in parallel to determine whether there is a hit or a miss. This requires a large number of comparators, which increases the complexity and cost of implementing large caches. Hence, fully-associative caches are typically used for smaller caches (usually less than 4K).

4. Disadvantage of a fully-associative cache?
- There are a few disadvantages to using a fully-associative cache:
  - It is expensive to implement due to the requirement for parallel checks on all cache lines.
  - Implementing this scheme adds complexity to the cache design.

5. How do some processors handle caching for data and instructions?
- Some processors handle caching for data and instructions by having a slightly slower, separate cache for data. This helps in avoiding conflicts between instructions and data, ensuring efficient caching.","[Front: How could you implement an LRU cache?

  - DEFLATE is a lossless compression algorithm based on LZ77. It is used in Gzip, WinZip, and mod_deflate, which is bundled with Apache web server for automated gzip compression of HTTP-served content. It uses LZ77 and Huffman coding.

- How does LZ77-based compression work?
  - LZ77 is a dictionary encoding algorithm that compresses based on the occurrence of repeated strings of characters in the message. It partitions the input into a search buffer and a look-ahead buffer. The search buffer has a maximum size of 32KB. It compares the symbols in the look-ahead buffer with the symbols in the search buffer to find a copy of the symbol. If a match is found, it checks the second symbol of the look-ahead buffer to see if it also matches the predecessor. By detecting long phrases of symbols, it can encode them as one unit. This process implicitly creates a rolling statistical probability for each symbol/phrase.

- What is Huffman encoding?
  - Huffman encoding algorithm analyzes the occurrence of individual symbols and creates a binary tree where common symbols are closest to the root and have fewer bits for encoding. Less common/rare symbols have longer paths on the tree, resulting in longer encodings. By traversing the tree, from root to leaf, and keeping track of 1 or 0 at each node, we can determine the encoding of the symbol.

- What is the primary factor of compression?
  - The primary factor of compression is the probability of redundant portions of input.

- How can you maximize compression?
  - Compression can be maximized by deeply analyzing the given input to reduce redundancy as much as possible.

- What compression scheme uses Burrows-Wheeler transform?
  - BZip2 compression scheme uses Burrows-Wheeler transform.

- What is the Burrows-Wheeler transform?
  - The Burrows-Wheeler transform is a compression method that involves sorting all possible rotations of the input text into lexicographic order. The output includes the last column and the index of the row where the original text appears. To decode, take the single column and repeatedly add the final column's characters to each of the rows, sorting each time. Once the length of the column's height is reached, use the index to find the output string","[Front: What is LZ* compression based on?

[Front: How does LZ77-based compression work? Back: LZ77 is a dictionary encoding algorithm, which is a statistical encoding algorithm. Compression in the LZ77 algorithm is based on the notion that strings of characters (words, phrases, etc.) occur repeatedly in the message being compressed.  The input is partitioned into 2 segments: a search buffer and a look-ahead buffer. The search buffer maxes out at 32KB. Starting with one character in the LA buffer, it looks back in the search buffer to find a copy of the symbol. If one is found, it looks at the second symbol of the LA buffer to see if it also matches the predecessor. Using this method, it can detect long phrases of symbols and encode them as one unit.

"- What is multiprogramming?
  - Multiprogramming is a technique that makes one processor appear as multiple processors, each handling one process at a time. It allows for better utilization of the processor's resources by running multiple programs concurrently.

- What triggers a context switch?
  - A context switch is triggered by various events such as timer interrupt, hardware interrupt, I/O operations where the system is waiting for a read or write to complete, or a voluntary yield by a process. It involves saving the current state of a process and loading the saved state of another process to continue its execution.

- What is dual-mode operation?
  - Dual-mode operation is a feature of a computer's hardware that provides at least two modes: user mode and kernel (also known as supervisor or protected) mode. User mode is used for executing user programs, while kernel mode provides access to privileged instructions and resources of the operating system.

- How does the OS run a program?
  - The operating system runs a program by executing an ""exec"" function from kernel mode (system mode 1). This transition switches the execution mode to system mode 0, also known as user mode. When the program completes or exits, the operating system switches back to kernel mode.","[Front: What is multiprogramming?

"- How does a user program interact with the kernel?
  - A user program interacts with the kernel by making a system call. The program requests a particular service or resource from the operating system, and the kernel takes control, completes the requested action, and returns the result to the user program, switching back to user mode.

- What happens when the hardware needs something to happen?
  - When the hardware needs something to happen, it generates an interrupt. The interrupt signals the operating system, hardware interrupts, timer interrupts, or I/O interrupts. The operating system then takes control, saves the current process state, switches to the appropriate interrupt handler, and once the hardware task is complete, the operating system returns from the interrupt, resuming the execution of the interrupted process.

- What happens when a program makes an exception?
  - When a program encounters an exception, such as a divide by zero error or access to an invalid memory address, it terminates and switches to kernel mode. The kernel then handles the exception, taking appropriate actions such as terminating the program or handling the error.

- What is base and bound?
  - Base and bound is a memory addressing restriction technique where each process is allowed access to the memory between a base address and the bound address plus the base address. Each process has its own base and bound values, defining a dedicated memory region. A drawback of this technique is that the process does not have access to address 0. Address translation can be used to overcome this limitation.

- How does the OS know how to handle an interrupt?
  - The operating system keeps an interrupt vector, which is a table or array in memory, containing information about various types of interrupts. Each interrupt type is associated with an address (pointer) that points to the code in the operating system that handles that particular interrupt. When an interrupt occurs, the processor uses the interrupt vector to locate the appropriate handler code and transfers control to it","[Front: How does a user program interact with the kernel?

- P() [proberen, to test/probe]: atomic operation that waits for semaphore to become > 1, then decrements it by 1 (wait) 
- V() [verhogen, to increment]: an atomic operation that increments the semaphore by 1, waking up any P (signal). The initial semaphore value will determine how many threads can run in the critical section at once.

- What's another name for a mutual exclusion? 
Binary semaphore.

- What is a monitor? 
A lock and zero or more condition variables for managing concurrent access to shared data.

- What should locks and condition variables each be used for? 
locks: mutual exclusion 
condition variables: scheduling constraints

- What is a condition variable? 
A queue of threads waiting for access to something in a critical section.

- What is a special feature of condition variables? 
It allows sleeping inside a critical section by atomically releasing lock at the time we sleep.

- What are the 3 methods on a condition variable? 
wait(&lock), signal(), broadcast(","[Front: What is the priority inversion problem?

"- Most modern processors use Mesa-scheduling for task scheduling.
- The scheduler tries to accomplish several things:
  - Minimize response time.
  - Maximize throughput.
  - Ensure fairness.
- A drawback of context switching is CPU cache misses when a thread comes back from switching and finds that the CPU cache doesn't have the values it had before.
- The convoy effect refers to short processes getting stuck behind long processes in a FIFO-style ready queue.
- The round-robin scheduling scheme assigns each process a time quantum (q milliseconds) to run. Each process runs for that time slice (or until completion if close to done) and then goes back on the ready queue.
- Pros of the round-robin scheduling scheme include better handling of short jobs and fairness.
- A con of the round-robin scheduling scheme is that long jobs take longer due to the cumulative time spent on context switching.
- Context switching typically takes between 0.1ms to 1ms, resulting in roughly 1% overhead.
- Starvation occurs when low-priority jobs never get run because higher priority jobs are always running.","[Front: What type of scheduling do most modern processors use? Back: Mesa-scheduling.],

"- The scheduler changes a process' priority based on heuristics related to interactivity, locking, burst behavior, and more.
- Methods of avoiding deadlock include not allowing waiting for a resource (which leads to retries), having threads request all necessary resources at the beginning, enforcing a specific order for resource requests to prevent cyclic resource usage, and temporarily expanding resources when a deadlock is detected.
- The banker's algorithm is a deadlock prevention algorithm that dynamically allocates resources and evaluates each request, granting it only if some ordering of threads remains deadlock-free after the request. This is achieved by simulating the request as granted and checking for deadlocks.
- The banker's algorithm can solve the dining lawyers problem by ensuring that when trying to grab a chopstick, it is either not the last chopstick or it is the last chopstick but someone else will have two chopsticks afterward.
- The CPU uses virtual addresses.
- Virtual to physical address translation is performed by the memory management unit (MMU).

"1. What is a stack canary?
   - A stack canary is a buffer overflow defense mechanism. It involves pushing a random value onto the stack after the saved EBP (Extended Base Pointer). Before tearing down the stack frame, the value is checked. Any buffer overflow targeting the return instruction pointer would have to overwrite this random value.

2. What type of buffer overflow protection does gcc and Visual Studio employ?

It’s a toolkit that provides an actor model, runtime, and required supporting tools for building scalable applications.],
[Front: What is an actor? Back: Briefly, actors are a lot like message queues without the configuration and message broker installation overhead. They’re like programmable message queues shrunk to microsize—you can easily create thousands, even millions of them. They don’t “do” anything unless they’re sent a message. Messages are simple data structures that can’t be changed after they’ve been created, or in a single word, they’re immutable. Actors can receive messages one at a time and execute some behavior whenever a message is received. Unlike queues, they can also send messages (to other actors). Everything an actor does is executed asynchronously. Simply put, you can send a message to an actor without waiting for a response. Actors aren’t like threads, but messages sent to them are pushed through on a thread at some point in time. How actors are connected to threads is configurable - this is not a hardwired relationship. For now the most important aspect of actors is that you build applications by sending and receiving messages. A message could be processed locally on some available thread, or remotely on another server. Exactly where the message is processed and where the actor lives are things you can decide later, which is very different compared to hardcoding threads and RPC style networking. Actors make it easy to build your application out of small parts that resemble networked services, only shrunk to microsize in footprint and administrative overhead.],

[Front: What is ZooKeeper? Back: Apache ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed. Has Java and C interfaces.],
[Front: What is orthogonality? Back: In mathematical terms, it means being perpendicular.  Orthogonality in programming language design is the ability to use various language features in arbitrary combinations with consistent results.  Orthogonality is a system design property which guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system. Typically this is achieved through the separation of concerns and encapsulation, and it is essential for feasible and compact designs of complex systems. The emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration, i.e., non-orthogonal design of modules and interfaces. Orthogonality reduces testing and development time because it is easier to verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them.]"
"1. When dealing with scaling, how can you deal with rapidly increasing counters, like YouTube video views?
   - To deal with rapidly increasing counters like YouTube video views, adding randomness to a monotonic counter can be a solution. As long as people can see that the counter is increasing somewhat monotonically, it doesn't need to be 100% accurate. This approach avoids the need to lock the counter in a transaction.

2. What is exponential backoff and when is it used?
   - Exponential backoff, also known as truncated binary exponential backoff, is an algorithm used to space out repeated retransmissions of network or other service requests. It is often used as part of congestion avoidance when congestion is detected.

3. What data structure could be used to efficiently manage a leaderboard?
   - A b-tree can be used to efficiently manage a leaderboard. Each node in the b-tree manages a subset of the range of the worst to best scores.

4. What does adding jitter in system design help you avoid?
   - Adding jitter in system design helps avoid thundering herds, which occur when multiple requests or events synchronize and overwhelm the system. Jitter introduces more randomness, preventing things from stacking up and creating synchronization issues.

5. What is an example of adding jitter to a caching system?
   - An example of adding jitter to a caching system is by jittering cache expirations. Instead of all items expiring at the same time, a random expiration time within a range is used. This prevents requests from stacking up and causing synchronization issues.

6. What value can you make cron or other system intervals so they don't coincide?
   - Distinct prime numbers can be used as values for cron or other system intervals to avoid coinciding. This approach ensures that periodic tasks have unique intervals and reduces the chances of synchronization issues.","[Front: When dealing with scaling, how can you deal with rapidly increasing counters, like YouTube video views?

[Front: What is an example of adding jitter to a caching system? Back: Cache expirations. For a popular video they cache things as best they can. The most popular video they might cache for 24 hours. If everything expires at one time then every machine will calculate the expiration at the same time. This creates a thundering herd. By jittering you are saying randomly expire between 18-30 hours. That prevents things from stacking up. They use this all over the place. Systems have a tendency to self synchronize as operations line up and try to destroy themselves. Fascinating to watch. You get slow disk system on one machine and everybody is waiting on a request so all of a sudden all these other requests on all these other machines are completely synchronized. This happens when you have many machines and you have many events. Each one actually removes entropy from the system so you have to add some back in.],

"1. What Python package provides tools for adapting or extending functions and other callable objects, without completely rewriting them?
   - The functools package in Python provides tools for adapting or extending functions and other callable objects without the need for complete rewrites. It offers features like decorators, comparison, collation order, caching, and reducing a data set.

2. What is a proxy server?
   - A proxy server is an intermediate piece of hardware or software that receives requests from clients and relays them to the backend origin servers. Proxy servers are commonly used to filter requests, log requests, or transform requests by adding/removing headers, encrypting/decrypting, or compression.

3. What is collapsed forwarding?
   - Collapsed forwarding is a technique where a proxy server can combine or collapse the same or similar requests into one request and then return the single result to the requesting clients. This can help reduce unnecessary duplicate requests and improve efficiency.

4. What should be handling requests first, a proxy server or a cache?
   - In general, it is best to place the cache in front of the proxy server. The cache serves data from memory, making it fast and capable of handling multiple requests for the same result without incurring additional latency. Placing the cache behind the proxy would introduce additional latency for every request before reaching the cache, potentially hindering performance","[Front: What Python package provides tools for adapting or extending functions and other callable objects, without completely rewriting them?

  Back: Indexes tend to slow down writes because both writing the data and updating the index need to be done simultaneously.
- Front: What is the role of a load balancer?
  Back: The role of a load balancer is to distribute load across a set of nodes responsible for servicing requests. It allows multiple nodes to handle the same function in a system, thus enabling scalability by adding more nodes.

  Back: Adding asynchrony to a system prevents clients from holding connections to servers while waiting for a response. This reduces server load and allows tasks to be performed when ready, rather than on-demand.
- Front: What is the difference between a synchronous system and an asynchronous system?
  Back: In a synchronous system, there is no differentiation between request and reply, and they cannot be managed separately. In an asynchronous system, the client requests a task, receives a message acknowledging the task, periodically checks its status, and requests the result once completed. Clients can perform other work while waiting for an asynchronous request to complete.

"- Front: How do context switches perform under virtualization?

"- To find how many items are between x and y in a splay tree, the tree can be augmented by storing the size of subtrees at each node. To find x, splay it to the root while maintaining the size in each node. Then, while finding y, sum up the sizes in the left subtrees and add 1 for each visited left-hand node. Finally, splay y to the root to ensure balance.

"- In testing, an oracle is a mechanism used by software testers and engineers to determine if a test has passed or failed. Oracles compare the output of the system under test, for a given test-case input, to the expected output determined by the oracle.

- When testing interfaces with a trust boundary, various inputs, including random inputs, are used to ensure that the system can handle them correctly without crashing.

- The Python flag `-O` turns on optimizations and removes assertions from the code. This can improve the execution speed but should be used when the code is production-ready and not during development or debugging.

- Performing substantial work in a constructor is discouraged as it can make the code harder to test. Constructors should generally focus on initializing object state rather than performing complex calculations or operations.

- To make testing easier and possible, certain practices should be avoided, including the use of static methods and properties, the final keyword, and the use of the `new` keyword in methods (instead, dependency injection should be utilized).

- A setter is also known as a mutator, as it modifies the value of an attribute or property of an object.

- A getter is also known as an accessor, as it retrieves the value of an attribute or property of an object.

- To avoid violating the dependency inversion principle, some guidelines can be followed. These include avoiding variables with concrete class types and preferring abstract types instead. Additionally, classes should not derive from concrete classes, and methods should not override implemented methods of their base classes.

2. What is separate chaining?
    - In hash table conflict resolution, each bucket is independent and has some sort of linked list of entries with the same index. The time for hash table operations is the time to find the bucket (which is constant) plus the time for the list operation. In a good hash table, each bucket has zero or one entries, and sometimes two or three, but rarely more than that. Therefore, structures that are efficient in time and space for these cases are preferred. Structures that are efficient for a fairly large number of entries per bucket are not needed or desirable. If these cases happen often, the hashing function needs to be fixed.
    - Separate chaining is a method used to handle collisions in hash tables. It involves creating a linked list of entries for each bucket in the hash table, where each entry with the same index is stored in a separate chain.

3. What is open addressing?
    - In hash table conflict resolution, all entry records are stored in the bucket array itself. When a new entry has to be inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the hashed-to slot and proceeding in some probe sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found. When searching for an entry, the buckets are scanned in the same sequence, until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates that there is no such key in the table. The name ""open addressing"" refers to the fact that the location (""address"") of the item is not determined by its hash value. (This method is also called closed hashing; it should not be confused with ""open hashing"" or ""closed addressing"" that usually mean separate chaining.)
    - Open addressing is another method used to handle collisions in hash tables. It involves storing all the entries in slots within the bucket array itself, rather than using separate chains. If a collision occurs, the algorithm probes through the array to find the next available slot.

4. What is the length of the longest chain in a hash table using separate chaining?
    - O(1 + alpha) where alpha is the load factor, n/m.
    - The length of the longest chain in a hash table using separate chaining is proportional to the load factor (n/m), where n is the number of entries and m is the number of buckets. As the load factor increases, the length of the chains also increases, impacting the performance of the hash table.

5. Since uniform hashing is difficult to achieve in practice, what is a great alternative?
    - Double hashing
    - Double hashing is an alternative method to achieve better hash table performance when uniform hashing is difficult. It involves using a secondary hash function to resolve collisions by probing through the hash table.

6. How can you test if a number is odd in bitwise operations?
    - return (x & 1)
    - To test if a number is odd using bitwise operations, you can perform a bitwise AND operation between the number and 1. If the result is non-zero, the number is odd.

    - return (x & 1) == 0

Once constructed, several operations can be performed quickly, for instance locating a substring in S, locating a substring if a certain number of mistakes are allowed, locating matches for a regular expression pattern etc. Suffix trees also provide one of the first linear-time solutions for the longest common substring problem.

"1. How can you optimize finding a pivot when the segment to pivot is large (not random choice)?
- Choose a median of three.

2. What is counting sort?
- Counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values.

3. What is radix sort?
- Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value. Two classifications of radix sorts are least significant digit (LSD) radix sorts and most significant digit (MSD) radix sorts.

4. What is the counting sort running time?
- The running time of counting sort is O(q + n) where q is the number of unique items. If q is in O(n), then it has a linear time complexity.

5. What radix is most natural to use?

6. How would radix sort work for IEEE floating point numbers?
- For IEEE floating point numbers, you need to flip all bits for negative numbers, then perform the sort, and finally, flip the bits back.

7. How to choose q for radix sort?
- Choose q within a power of 2 of n. This ensures that the number of passes is small. The best rule is to round n down to the next power of 2. Alternatively, you can round sqrt(n) down to the next power of 2, but this will require twice as many passes.

2. How would you calculate P(A or B)?
   - The probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring can be calculated by adding their individual probabilities (P(A) + P(B)) and subtracting the probability of both (P(A and B)).

3. What's another way to write P(A and B)?
   - Another way to represent the probability of both events A and B occurring is by using the notation P(AB).

4. What is a Markov chain?
   - A Markov chain is a mathematical model that consists of various states connected by transitions labeled with probabilities. It is used to describe a system where the future state only depends on the current state and not on the past states. The states can represent any state or entity, not necessarily words.

5. Write a function that computes the sqrt(n) using binary search.
   - To calculate the square root of a number 'n' using binary search, we can iterate through the possible values of the square root, using 'low' and 'high' as the initial boundaries. We then update these boundaries based on whether the midpoint squared is greater or less than 'n', until we find the square root accurate to a desired precision. 

6. What is P(A|A)?
   - The conditional probability P(A|A) is equal to 1, as given that event A has occurred, the probability of A happening again is certain.

7. At how many items should you expect a collision when hashing among n buckets?

"1. What is an interface in object-oriented programming?
   - An interface in object-oriented programming (OO) is similar to an abstract data type. It defines the expected behaviors that a class should implement but does not suggest an implementation. It serves as a contract that specifies what methods a class should have without specifying how they should be implemented.

2. What is a framework?
   - A framework is a reusable piece of software that implements a generic solution to a generalized problem. It saves time by providing a close model of the problem domain and allows the implementer to fill in the specific details. Frameworks can be highly customizable and cover a wide range of functionalities.

"1. What are the 2 algorithms for convex hull? 
   - Answer: The two algorithms for convex hull are Graham scan and Jarvis march (gift-wrapping method).

2. How does a Graham scan work in finding convex hull? 
   - Answer: A Graham scan finds convex hull at O(n log n) time complexity. It starts by sorting the points and then performs a simple single pass through all the points, making only left turns as it goes around the perimeter counter-clockwise. When the next point is a right turn, it backtracks past all points using a stack and popping points off until that turn becomes a left turn.

3. How does the Jarvis march work in finding convex hull? 
   - Answer: The Jarvis march finds convex hull starting with the leftmost point, denoted as p. It goes through each point to the right of p and, using p as a pivot, finds which point is the most clockwise. This process continues until the starting point is reached, creating the convex hull. The time complexity of Jarvis march is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n refers to the number of input points.

4. What is the worst case time complexity of a Jarvis march? 
   - Answer: The worst case time complexity of a Jarvis march is O(n^2). This occurs when most points are part of the hull and few points are contained within the hull.

5. What is the average complexity of a Jarvis march? 
   - Answer: The average complexity of a Jarvis march is O(n * h), where n is the number of input points and h is the number of points that compose the hull.

6. What is white-box testing? 
   - Answer: White-box testing refers to a testing approach where the tester has knowledge of the program's internals. This includes understanding the code, data structures, and algorithms used.

7. What is black-box testing? 
   - Answer: Black-box testing refers to a testing approach where the tester tests the program without knowledge of its internals. The focus is solely on input-output behavior and functionality.

8. What is unit testing? 
   - Answer: Unit testing is the process of testing a single module or component of a program in isolation. It helps ensure that the individual units of code perform correctly.

9. What factors can affect testing, apart from API inputs? 
   - Answer: Apart from API inputs, factors that can affect testing include timing of inputs, disk full scenarios, network latency, and network failures.

10. In what situations is the timing of inputs important in testing?

"1. Insert (binary heap):
   - Time Complexity: O(log N)
   - Explanation: When inserting an element into a binary heap, it is placed at the next available position in the array representation of the complete heap-ordered binary tree. Then, it is ""bubbled up"" by comparing it with its parent and swapping positions if necessary. This process continues until the heap property is restored.
   
2. RemoveMin (binary heap):
   - Time Complexity: O(log N)
   - Explanation: Removing the minimum element from a binary heap involves swapping it with the last element in the heap and then ""bubbling down"" that element to its correct position. This is done by comparing it with its children and swapping positions if necessary. The process continues until the heap property is restored.
   
3. Build (binary heap):
   - Time Complexity: O(N)
   - Explanation: Building a binary heap from an arbitrary array involves inserting each element into the heap one by one using the insert operation. Since the insert operation takes O(log N) time, when performed on all elements, the total time complexity becomes O(N log N). However, using a bottom-up approach, we can reduce the time complexity to O(N). The array is seen as a complete binary tree, and elements from the second half of the array (ignoring leaves) are ""bubbled down"" individually to their correct positions. This process is repeated for all parent nodes until the heap property is restored.

4. What is a binary heap?
   - Explanation: A binary heap is a collection of keys arranged in a complete heap-ordered binary tree, represented in level order in an array (not using the first entry). The parent of the node in position k is in position [k/2], and the two children of the node in position k are in positions 2k and 2k+1. The heap property states that for a min-heap, the key of every parent node is less than or equal to the key of its children nodes.

5. What is an Adaptable Priority Queue?
   - Explanation: An adaptable priority queue is a priority queue that allows you to change the priority of objects already in the queue. In addition to the standard operations found in a priority queue (e.g., insert, removeMin), an adaptable priority queue provides methods to update the priority of a specific element in the queue.

In the worst case, it may require O(N^2) comparisons and swaps, which occurs when the pivot selection is not optimal (e.g., selecting the smallest or largest element as the pivot). However, with a good choice of pivot (e.g., median of the array), quicksort exhibits a time complexity of O(N log N) in the best case and expected case, making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms.","[Front: insert (binary heap) Back: O(log N)],

2. k-th smallest (full heap):
   - Time Complexity: O(N + k log N)
   - Explanation: To find the k-th smallest element in a collection of values using a full heap, all values are inserted into the heap, and then the removeMin operation is performed k times.

"1. What is a connected graph?
   - Explanation: A connected graph is a graph in which there exists a path from every vertex to every other vertex. In other words, for any two vertices in a connected graph, there is at least one path that connects them.

2. What is a tree?
   - Explanation: A tree is an acyclic connected graph. It is a special type of graph where there are no cycles, and each pair of vertices is connected by a unique path. In a tree, there is a unique path between any two vertices, and every vertex, except the root (if defined), has exactly one parent.

3. What is a cycle?
   - Explanation: A cycle in a graph refers to a path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same. In other words, starting from a vertex and following a sequence of edges, if one can return to the same vertex without traversing any previously visited edges (except the incident edge to the starting vertex), then a cycle exists in the graph","[Front: What is a connected graph?

"- Fetch-execute cycle: The fetch-execute cycle is a system that describes how actions are performed in the CPU. It consists of four parts: fetching instructions from memory, decoding the instructions to determine the operation to be performed, retrieving data if needed, and executing the instructions to produce results.
- Control Unit (CU): The Control Unit is responsible for controlling, organizing, and handling all the processes and instructions received by the CPU. It plays a vital role in the fetch-execute cycle by managing the execution of instructions. The Control Unit has special purpose registers, such as the Instruction Register and the Program Counter, which help in executing instructions effectively","[Front: What is the fetch-execute cycle?

"1. The F1 score is calculated as 2 multiplied by the precision and recall, divided by the sum of precision and recall. It represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall and is used as a single measurement to evaluate a model's performance.
2. The F1 score is also known as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, capturing both precision and recall in a single value.
3. The trade-off between precision and recall is evident in the model's predictive behavior. A model that is more confident in predicting ""yes"" even with low certainty will have high recall but low precision. Conversely, a model that predicts ""yes"" only with high certainty will have higher precision but lower recall. This trade-off can also be viewed as a balance between false positives and false negatives.
